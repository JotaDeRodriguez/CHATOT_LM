Frail, low defenses. After Psycho Boost, SpA drops 2 stages. Team strategy: Use Cradily as special pivot to Toxic fast threats, Recover to stall. Jirachi as special sweeper with CM later. Shiftry Choice Band physical breaker for late game. Watch for opponent switches to counters like Snorlax or Kyogre.\n\nDeoxys-A confirmed Superpower user; Atk/Def -1. Beware Extreme Speed priority on switch-in. Jirachi resists key moves; aim to CM up vs weakened Deoxys. Opponent may switch to bulky water/ground like Kyogre/Swampert; preserve Shiftry for sun sweep if Chlorophyll activated, Hitmontop for Intimidate checks.\n\nDeoxys-A debuffed; likely switches out to avoid CM sweeps. If Kyogre in, Jirachi's HP Dark or Fire Punch can pressure. Monitor for Wobbuffet or other walls. Shiftry for Band Explosion sac if needed; Hitmontop Intimidate for physical checks. Win con: CM Jirachi sweeps late if walls softened.\n\nDeoxys-A at -2 Atk/Def, full HP; likely switches out this turn to preserve it or uses Psycho Boost (resisted, drops its SpA). Jirachi to +2 SpA/SpD after CM, can threaten most of opponent's team with Psychic. Prepare switches: Hitmontop Intimidate for physical walls like Snorlax; Shiftry Band for breaking bulky waters (Solar Beam on Kyogre/Swampert). Watch for priority on switches. Win con: +2 Jirachi sweeps if Deoxys removed early.\n\nJirachi now at +3 SpA/SpD post-CM; Psychic will hit hard (SE on Kyogre, neutral on Swampert but boosted). Deoxys-A crippled physically; expect switch to bulky Water (Kyogre CB/SW) or Ground (Swampert). If Kyogre, HP Dark or Fire Punch chips; Shiftry Solar Beam ready. Hitmontop Intimidate sac vs physical walls like Snorlax if revealed. Preserve Jirachi as win con; sac Shiftry Explosion if needed to remove threats.\n\nMetagross: Likely Choice Band or Leftovers, Agility/Meteor Mash/EQ/Thunder Punch set with Clear Body preventing Intimidate. Deoxys-A at -2 Atk/Def, preserved for priority threats later. Jirachi +3 can threaten most switches with HP Dark (hits Rayquaza, Wobbuffet). If Metagross Agilities, next turn Psychic or CM depending on speed tie. Preserve Hitmontop Intimidate for Snorlax/Groudon if revealed; Shiftry Band Solar Beam for Kyogre/Swampert. Win con: Remove Metagross, resume CM Jirachi to sweep remaining team.\n\nJirachi down early; lost setup sweeper. Metagross at 55%, likely locked into EQ/Meteor Mash (assume CB). Switch Hitmontop to tank hit, then Hi Jump Kick KO. Shiftry preserve for Kyogre/Swampert (Solar Beam/Brick Break) or Deoxys (Shadow Ball). Watch for opponent Deoxys ES priority on future switches. Team left: Hitmontop (Intimidate for Snorlax/Groudon), Shiftry (Band breaker). Prioritize removing Metagross to avoid Agility setup.\n\nMetagross likely CB locked EQ; HJK aims for KO despite speed disadvantage. If survives, follow up with Rock Slide or Bulk Up next. Shiftry preserve for Band Brick Break on Swampert or Solar Beam on Kyogre. Expect Deoxys-A return for ES priority; Hitmontop can Intimidate future physical switch-ins like Snorlax.

High Jump Kick (130 BP, STAB Fighting, neutral on Steel/Psychic) from Hitmontop's high Atk (317) should KO Metagross outright, removing a major threat. Speeds are tied (both base 70, Hitmontop at 204 likely faster with EVs). Avoid switching to Shiftry now, as it could eat a potential Explosion or EQ.

No, but tanks physical). Opponent may have Kyogre/Groudon next; Shiftry weak to water, Cradily handles ground. Long-term: Use Shiftry CB after chipping walls.\n\nTeam down to Cradily (wall/Toxic stall) and Shiftry (CB breaker/Explosion sac). Opp remaining 2 likely Ubers (Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza?). Prioritize Toxic on switch-ins to chip. Cradily handles physical Ubers well; switch to Shiftry if opp weakened physical wall or for super-effective CB hits. Watch for weather setters (Drought/ Drizzle). Long-term: Stall with Cradily, then Shiftry sweeps chipped foes.\n\nMewtwo (Pressure, unknown item): Likely special CM sweeper (Psychic/Ice Beam/Thunderbolt/Recover). Toxic applied turn 4—track poison damage (1/16 init, ticks up to 15/16). Expect CM attempts; if boosted, prioritize Recover over attacks to bait. Cradily can tank 1-2 boosted Ice Beams post-Recover. Shiftry sac with Explosion if Mewtwo low + last mon revealed. Opp remaining 2: Suspect Kyogre (Cradily walls Water/Thunder, Toxic it) or Groudon/Rayquaza (Shiftry CB Brick Break on Groudon, Shadow Ball on Ray if needed).

Available actions only list a switch to Shiftry, but logically, we should act with Cradily to maintain the stall plan. Mewtwo is faster and likely to use Ice Beam (super effective 2x on Cradily, but Cradily's high SpD and HP can tank an unboosted hit for ~40-60% damage). Prioritize Toxic to poison Mewtwo immediately, starting chip damage (Pressure will make status last longer if it Recovers).

Track if Omastar survives for damage calc. Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible. Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and can KO or heavily damage Mewtwo. Monitor Mewtwo HP after sand chip (now 94%, -6% this turn). Opponent has 3 unknown Pokemon; prepare Kyogre switch if Mewtwo goes for Thunder or switches to Electric threat. Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1). CB EQ likely OHKOs Slaking; if not, follow-up next turn. Opponent has 2 unknown Pokemon left—EQ hits most neutrally, immune to Electric/Flying if they switch those. Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later. Hitmontop full as defensive option against special attackers.\n\nSlaking KO'd by Nidoking EQ. Opponent down to 2 Pokémon: likely Electric/Grass types to counter Kyogre. Nidoking ~23% and locked into EQ—switch out next turn based on opponent's reveal (e.g., Tyranitar vs physical threats, Hitmontop to Intimidate special attackers, Kyogre only if safe). Rain expires post-turn; prioritize Tyranitar entry for sand chip damage and DD setup if matchup favors. Preserve Hitmontop as late-game pivot; Kyogre can CM under new sand if needed, but low HP risks revenge.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 9 via safe EQ. Opponent's final Pokémon switches in; likely a strong Ubers threat (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon, Lugia). Next turn: switch Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate and preserve locked low-HP Nidoking. Evaluate last mon's type/ role upon reveal: HJK if weak to Fighting, Rock Slide for Flying, HP (likely Flying/Grass) for coverage, Bulk Up if setup safe. If last mon special attacker, Hitmontop SpD tanky; pivot back to Tyranitar if physical. Kyogre/Tyranitar low but Lum/LO for stall or sac if needed. Win con: Hitmontop revenge or setup vs last mon.\n\nSwampert revealed: Water/Ground, Torrent, likely physical with EQ/Water STAB/Ice coverage; immune to EQ, threatens Water-weak foes in rain. Switched Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate (lowers ATK) and safe scouting—HJK neutral but Bulk Up possible post-Intimidate. Opponent's final unknown mon: prepare for Ubers threat (e.g., Electric/Grass for Kyogre, physical wall). Post-rain end, pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream chip and DD if matchup good; Kyogre low but can CM under sand if protected. Win con: Hitmontop stalls/sets vs Swampert, then sweep with boosted team vs last mon; preserve low-HP mons for sacs if needed.\n\nHitmontop sac with HJK: est. 40-50% to Swampert. Next turn: Switch Nidoking vs. damaged Swampert for CB EQ (~30-40% more, total possible KO). If Swampert survives, expect Torrent Waterfall; Nidoking vulnerable but Ground STAB helps vs. last mon if switches. Final mon unknown—anticipate Electric/Grass (Kyogre counters) or physical wall; use Tyranitar sand chip/DD setup post-rain end (upkeep continues 8 turns). Kyogre CM opportunity once safe. Preserve Lum on Tyranitar for status. Win con: Nidoking + team sweeps final two.\n\nSac Nidoking to whiff EQ this turn; expect Hydro Pump KO next. Pivot to Kyogre post-sac (resists Hydro Pump, can CM vs Swampert's low SpA). Tyranitar preserved for sand reset/DD vs final mon (likely Electric/Grass threat). Swampert 74%, -1 Atk; Hydro Pump locked if Choice, else EQ. Final opponent mon unknown—heavy Ubers threat; use sand chip/Intimidate if possible, but team low HP requires careful sacs/positioning for CM/DD sweeps.\n\nSwitched Kyogre in vs Swampert (80%, -1 Atk); plan CM setup next turn if Swampert stays (tanks Water/EQ neutrally, Ice Beam resisted if coverage). Nidoking preserved at 23% for EQ revenge vs last mon (e.g., Flying/Electric threats). Tyranitar at 17% for potential sand reset/DD vs final Ubers (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon). Opponent's last mon unknown—heavy threat likely; Kyogre LO recovery + rain boosts Surf/Thunder for sweep. Win con: CM Kyogre KOs Swampert then last mon; sac low-HP mons if needed for momentum."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Nidoking is Choice Band locked into Earthquake, which Swampert is immune to, resulting in a whiff.

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed.\n\nGroudon at 38% brn, physical set (EQ/SD likely); Ice Punch expected to KO, gaining free faint. Sun est. 2 turns left post-this. Post-KO, anticipate Kyogre switch (T-Bolt revenge, as sun weakens Water but Gengar resists/neutral); Rayquaza/Mewtwo possible (Ice Punch/Taunt). Preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened rematch; Misdreavus sac trap if setup threat emerges. Momentum with Gengar: Taunt setups, status physicals, coverage kills.\n\nSkarmory (F, full HP) switched in post-Groudon KO; likely defensive pivot w/ Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind, Sturdy possible. Thunderbolt SE chunk expected (high SpA vs mid SpD). Sun ~1-2 turns left (weakens potential Kyogre Water). Opp rem: likely Kyogre (Tbolt revenge), Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Pressure Skarmory, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs endgame; Misdreavus sac trap if setup emerges.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via T-Bolt; hazards (1 Spikes) active—minimize switches (Misdreavus sac only if trap needed, Granbull switch incurs 1/8 ~45 HP loss). Sun ending, favors vs potential Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, Water weakened). Opp final two: Prioritize T-Bolt (Kyogre/Water/Flying), Ice Punch (Rayquaza/Ground/Dragon), Taunt (Mewtwo/setup), Will-O-Wisp (physical threats). Gengar at ~91% post-turn, strong position; pivot to full HP Granbull for Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs endgame weakened team. Win con: Coverage kill threats, then Granbull cleans.\n\nCelebi switched in full HP, Natural Cure (cures status on switch, but irrelevant now); assume special/support set (Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Baton Pass/Lum Berry?). Taunt to deny healing/setup, force suboptimal play. Opponent's last two likely Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water) or Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Gengar near full, pressure with coverage post-Taunt. Granbull full HP for endgame Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs weakened foes; avoid switch (Spikes ~12% loss). Misdreavus low HP sac trap if setup emerges later. Win con: Disrupt Celebi, KO with follow-up, clean with Granbull.\n\nCelebi: special attacker (Psychic confirmed), Taunted (2 turns left); likely support set w/ Recover/Giga Drain but denied. Switched to Granbull to tank hit, preserve Gengar for coverage vs final mon. Opp last mon: high priority Tbolt/Ice Punch targets (Kyogre water weaken sun, Rayquaza dragon). Granbull plan: Bulk Up x1-2 + Return/EQ sweep endgame; Rest if needed. Spikes 1 layer—minimize further switches. Win con: Granbull cleans weakened final two w/ Intimidate + boosts."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Granbull is our setup sweeper with Bulk Up + high Atk Return for endgame cleaning.

Intimidate doesn't affect Celebi's special attacks, but Granbull's bulk allows it to setup safely. Staying in avoids Spikes damage on switches (Gengar/Misdreavus already low HP).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar.\n\nSkarmory final mon at 76% burned, Taunt reapplied turn 19 (lasts turns 20-22). Expect Pursuit/Drill Peck retaliation (~20-30%/hit); Gengar survives multiple while chipping ~25-30%/Ice Punch. Post-Taunt, Ice Punch x2-3 for KO. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) unused—unnecessary with Gengar's control. No further threats; focus on finishing.\n\nSkarmory stall set (Spikes, Pursuit, likely Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck); burned and Taunt-locked, physical output minimal (~10-15%/hit). Thunderbolt ~40-50% chunk est.; follow with 1-2 more attacks for KO next turn. Reserves (Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR) unused—preserve for potential future but unnecessary. Opponent team depleted (Deoxys/Groudon/Skarmory fainted); focus on clean finish.\n\nCelebi final mon: bulky special (Psychic/Recover/Giga Drain/Seed?), Natural Cure. Taunt locks utility 3 turns, enabling safe Lugia pivot + Toxic. Stall: Lugia Recover/Toxic vs attacks; Toxic ramps to KO despite Recover (net loss as ticks > heal eventually). Gengar sacced, Misdreavus preserved but unnecessary. No switches possible for opp. Sun 20 turns: boosts Grass but Lugia resists.\n\nSwitched to Misdreavus vs Taunted Celebi. Expect Psychic neutral hit post-Spikes; if survives (~10-15% est.), next Mean Look trap then Perish Song (PAR risk, but locks in 3-turn faint). If KO'd, Lugia final: Recover if safe, Toxic to ramp damage (Taunt blocks Celebi Recover), Whirlwind phaze if setup suspected. Celebi likely Psychic STAB, Giga Drain (sun-boosted neutral), Recover (blocked), utility like Baton Pass/Heal Bell (blocked). Natural Cure irrelevant without status. Win con: Trap Perish Song or Toxic stall-out; Lugia high SpD/Leftovers edges long fight.\n\nCelebi final mon, likely bulky special set (Psychic/Giga Drain/Recover/utility), Taunted (active turns 22-23/24). Perish Song forces Celebi faint end turn 25; Lugia (~20% post-Spikes) tanks resisted Psychics (est. 10-20% damage/hit), Recover turn 23-24 if below 50% for safety, Leftovers sustains. No further threats; win secured via trap countdown + stall."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Misdreavus is active at approximately 32% HP (103/324) and paralyzed, facing Celebi at full HP with Taunt active (lasting through turn 22, preventing Celebi from using status moves this turn). Celebi will likely use Psychic again, which is super effective against Misdreavus (Ghost-type) but estimated to deal only 10-15% damage based on prior analysis, allowing survival. The optimal play is to use Mean Look to trap Celebi, preventing any potential switch next turn. With Taunt expiring after this turn, Misdreavus can then use Perish Song on turn 23 to force Celebi to faint in 3 turns while trapped (end of turn 25). Paralysis carries a 25% chance of failure, but Mean Look is still the best attempt. If Misdreavus faints, switch to Lugia next turn for Toxic stall-out.
