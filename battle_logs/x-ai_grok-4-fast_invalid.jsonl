\"gastly\",\n    \"ariados\"\n  ]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent led with Lombre (Water/Grass, female, unknown ability/item/moves/stats beyond basics) - unusual for Ubers, possibly a sacrificial lead or stall attempt. Expect opponent to reveal stronger Pokemon soon (e.g., legendaries common in Ubers). My team: Ariados (bulky pivot, resists common types), Gastly (level 5 meme, use for Explosion/Thief utility or sac), Gardevoir (special sweeper, setup with Calm Mind, trace ability useful), Scizor (physical sweeper, Swords Dance + Agility for speed control). Preserve bulky mons early, position Gardevoir/Scizor for mid/late game sweeps. No damage calcs yet, but Ariados Sludge Bomb likely 40-60% on Lombre; watch for KO or poison. Long-term: Exploit Ubers meta, predict switches to Waters/Dragons with coverage.\n\nOpponent's Lombre lead set Rain (likely rain team, watch for Swampert/Kyogre/Suicune). Dusclops (Pressure, female) switched in - probable bulky set with WoW/Pain Split/Recover; low threat offensively but stalls well. Chipped with Psychic this turn. Ariados bulky pivot role: use to scout and absorb hits from predicted switches (e.g., Waters under rain). Team plan: Sacrifice Gastly for Explosion/Thief utility against setup sweepers. Setup Gardevoir vs weakened foes with Trace copying abilities. Scizor for late-game SD/Agility sweep vs weakened teams, watch for burns. No items revealed yet. Predict opponent switches to rain abuser if Dusclops pressured; coverage for Dragons/Grounds key.\n\nPrevious scratchpad notes hold: Rain team likely, Dusclops stall (revealed WoW, Pressure LO). Chipped Dusclops to 90% pre-LO, now 96%; next Psychic predicts another ~10% chip to ~86% post-LO. If opponent stays: Expect Recover/Pain Split (WoW useless on burned) or weak attack like Shadow Punch (neutral on Ariados, low damage). If switch: Likely rain abuser (Water/ground/dragon); Psychic coverage hits most neutrally (super vs Fighting/Poison, resisted by Steel/Psychic/Dark). Ariados post-burn damage + LO nets ~0 HP/turn, stall viable short-term. Team plan unchanged: Gastly sac/utility (Explosion vs setup, Thief for items), Gardevoir Trace setup sweeper mid-game, Scizor SD/Agility late sweep. Watch for opponent reveals; Ubers meta heavy on KYOGRE/GROUDON/MEWTW0. No damage calcs precise yet, but Ariados Spa 156 modest vs Dusclops bulk. Position to sac Ariados if needed after more scouts.\n\nUpdated strategy: Gen 3 Ubers rain stall opener confirmed (Lombre Rain Dance sac, Dusclops WoW/Shadow Ball stall). Opponent likely core: Dusclops + rain abuser (Kyogre/Omastar/Swampert?) + another bulky (Suicune?). My leads: Ariados pivot chipped Dusclops to 92%, now switching to Gardevoir for pressure. Team plan: Use Ariados/Gastly as early sac/pivots (Ariados Sludge Bomb coverage, Gastly Explosion vs setup/Thief items); Gardevoir mid-game Trace sweeper (CM + Psychic/TBolt, copy abilities like Drizzle/Marvel Scale); Scizor late SD/Agility sweep (Silver Wind/Hidden Power coverage, watch Fire/Flying). Damage notes: Ariados Psychic ~6-10% on Dusclops; Gardevoir Psychic est. 25-35% neutral. Watch switches: TBolt hits Waters/Grounds super in rain (100% acc), Psychic neutrals Ghosts/psychics. Preserve health, force reveals. If Dusclops Pain Splits on switch, minimal impact on full HP Gardevoir.\n\nGen 3 Ubers rain stall core confirmed: Lombre sac for Rain, Dusclops (Pressure, Leftovers, WoW/Shadow Ball, likely Recover/Pain Split/Swagger/Skill Swap) as wall. Chipped to ~92% prior; this Psychic aims to drop to ~60-70%, forcing Recover or switch. Opponent predicts attack, may Recover to full or Pain Split (but we move first, mitigating). If switch: Expect rain abuser (Kyogre/Swampert/Omastar/Kingdra) - TBolt super effective/accurate in rain. Avoid switching full HP mons to bait Pain Split. Team plan: Ariados (burned pivot, scout/chip neutrals with Psychic/Sludge Bomb); Gastly (low level sac: Explosion vs setup sweepers, Thief for items like Scarf/LO); Gardevoir (Trace sweeper: CM + Psychic/TBolt coverage, trace abilities like Drizzle/Multiscale for setup); Scizor (late-game: Agility/SD then Silver Wind/HP[?Ice/Fire] for coverage, but SD boosts physical Atk while Silver Wind special - hybrid set? Watch Fire/Fighting). Preserve Gardevoir/Scizor health for sweeps; sac Ariados/Gastly early if needed. No other opponent reveals; predict 2 more slots (likely Water/Ground abuser + another stall/setup like Suicune/Deoxys). Damage notes: Gardevoir Psychic ~25-35% on Dusclops; TBolt in rain ~100% acc, super on Waters. Long-term: Break stall with repeated chips, position coverage for switches, aim to setup once Dusclops pressured out.\n\nGen 3 Ubers rain stall core: Lombre (sac Rain setter, FNT), Dusclops (Pressure, Leftovers, WoW/Shadow Ball, likely Recover/Pain Split/Swagger; chipped to 66%, continue pressure). Rain fading soon (set turn 1, ~4-5 turns total). Opponent team: 2 remaining slots, predict rain abuser (Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra for Water STAB boosted) + stall/setup (Suicune/Deoxys/Mew). My team: Ariados (burned pivot/chipper, 61% HP, Psychic/Sludge Bomb for neutral/super coverage; sac viable after scouting); Gastly (lvl5 utility sac: Explosion vs setup sweepers like Mewtwo, Thief for items e.g., Scarf/LO); Gardevoir (FNT, was Trace CM sweeper with Psychic/TBolt coverage); Scizor (100% priority preserve: SD/Agility physical/special hybrid? Silver Wind special Bug STAB, HP[unknown type, assume Ice/Fire for coverage], Swords Dance boosts Atk for potential Roost/Bullet Punch if had, but moves suggest setup sweeper vs weakened teams). Damage notes: Ariados Psychic ~8-12% on Dusclops (prior hits confirm); Scizor Silver Wind est. 20-30% neutral on Dusclops if needed later. Long-term: Break stall by chipping Dusclops out, sac Ariados/Gastly early to scout/bait switches (e.g., Sludge Bomb/Explosion on predicted Waters/Dragons), setup Scizor once walls pressured. Watch for Pain Split on switches (mitigate by switching weakened Ariados), Swagger mind games, or Skill Swap (Pressure useless). Position coverage: Psychic/TBolt for Ghosts/Waters, Bug/Steel resists common Ubers (no Fire weakness exploited yet). Win con: Outlast stall, sweep with Scizor post-rain.\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent rain stall: Lombre (FNT, Rain setter), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/likely Recover/Pain Split/Swagger; chipped to 72%, next Psychic ~10-15% to ~55-60%, continue pressure to force Recover/switch). Team remaining: 2 slots, predict rain abuser (Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra Water STAB) + stall/setup (Suicune/Mew/Deoxys). My team: Ariados (burned pivot/chipper 54%, Psychic super vs Ghosts/Poisons, Sludge Bomb vs Grass/Fairies; sac viable soon for scout); Gastly (lvl5 utility: Explosion vs non-Ghost setup like Groudon/Salamence/Thief items on switches, Giga Drain/Thunderbolt coverage vs Waters/Grounds/Flyers); Gardevoir (FNT, was Trace CM sweeper); Scizor (100% preserve: Agility for speed outspeeding most Ubers post-setup, SD boosts Atk but Silver Wind/HP special - perhaps SD for Hidden Power if physical typing error, or hybrid vs weakened; Silver Wind Bug STAB neutral on most, HP assume Ice/Fire for Dragon/Water coverage; resists Ghost/Steel threats). Damage: Ariados Psychic ~10-15% on Dusclops; Scizor Silver Wind est. 25-35% neutral later. Plan: Chip Dusclops out with Ariados (net HP loss from burn/LO but short-term stall), sac Gastly/ weakened Ariados on predicted switches (Explosion/Thief vs abusers, Sludge Bomb vs Waters), setup Scizor Agility/SD once walls down for sweep (watch Fire/Fighting switches). If Pain Split predicted, switch weakened Ariados to minimize loss. Win con: Outchip stall, remove rain abuser with coverage/sac, sweep with boosted Scizor.\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent rain stall: Lombre (FNT, Rain setter), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/Recover/Pain Split/Swagger?; 67% HP, SpD -1). Remaining: 2 slots (rain abuser like Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra + stall/setup e.g., Suicune/Mew/Deoxys). My team: Ariados (burned pivot/chipper ~30% HP, sac viable for scout/Sludge Bomb on Waters/Grasses); Gastly (lvl5 utility sac: Explosion vs setup/non-Ghost like Groudon/Salamence, Thief items on switches, T-Bolt/Giga Drain coverage vs Waters/Grounds/Flyers); Gardevoir (FNT); Scizor (100% priority: Agility for Speed boost to outrun most Ubers, Silver Wind special Bug STAB neutral on Dusclops ~25-35% est., Hidden Power assume Ice/Fire for Dragon/Water/Grass coverage; SD boosts Atk but attacks special - use Agility primary, SD if physical moves implied or vs weakened; resists Ghost/Steel/Poison common threats, watch Fire/Fighting switches). Damage notes: Ariados Psychic ~5-6% on Dusclops; Scizor Silver Wind ~25-35% neutral on Dusclops, Agility sets up outspeed. Plan: Safe switch Scizor in vs Shadow Ball (minimal damage), Agility then attack to pressure Dusclops (force Recover/switch), sac Gastly/ Ariados on predicted abusers (Explosion/Thief/Sludge Bomb), setup Scizor sweep once walls down (post-rain, no weather boosts for opponent). If Pain Split/Swagger, minimal impact on Scizor bulk. Win con: Outchip stall early, remove abusers with sacs/coverage, late sweep boosted Scizor vs weakened team.\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent rain stall: Lombre (FNT), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/Recover/Pain Split/Swagger?; 73% HP, SpD -1). Remaining: 2 slots (rain abuser e.g., Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra + stall/setup e.g., Suicune/Mew/Deoxys; rain ended). My team: Ariados (burned ~30%, sac pivot: Psychic/Sludge Bomb scout coverage); Gastly (lvl5 full: Explosion sac vs setup/non-Ghost e.g., Groudon/Salamence, Thief items on switches, T-Bolt/Giga Drain vs Waters/Grounds/Flyers); Gardevoir (FNT); Scizor (95%, setup sweeper: Agility for +2 Spe to outrun Ubers, Silver Wind special Bug STAB neutral ~25-35% on Dusclops, Hidden Power Dark super vs Ghost/Psychic/Dark ~30-40% est., SD optional later if physical implied but focus special; resists Ghost/Steel/Poison, weak Fire/Fighting – watch switches). Damage notes: Scizor Silver Wind/HP Dark ~25-40% on Dusclops. Plan: Agility Scizor now (safe vs Recover/Split/Shadow Ball), then attack to pressure (force Recover loop or switch), sac Gastly/Ariados on predicted abusers (Explosion/Thief/T-Bolt/Sludge Bomb), setup further if safe for Scizor sweep vs weakened stall. If WoW, LO mitigates burn chip; predict Recover. Win con: Chip out Dusclops, sac vs abuser, sweep with boosted Scizor (post-rain neutralizes opponent boosts).\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent rain stall: Lombre (FNT, Rain setter), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/Recover/Pain Split/Swagger?; 79% HP post-last turn, SpD -1; Hidden Power Dark super effective ~35-50% est. damage to drop to ~30-50%, force Recover/switch/KO). Remaining: 2 slots (rain abuser e.g., Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra Water STAB, now unboosted post-rain; + stall/setup e.g., Suicune/Mew/Deoxys). My team: Ariados (burned ~30%, sac pivot: Psychic/Sludge Bomb scout vs Ghosts/Grasses/Waters); Gastly (lvl5 full: Explosion sac vs setup/non-Ghost e.g., Groudon/Salamence/Mewtwo, Thief items on switches, T-Bolt/Giga Drain vs Waters/Grounds/Flyers); Gardevoir (FNT); Scizor (~90%, +2 Spe setup sweeper: Agility done, Silver Wind special Bug STAB neutral ~20-30% on most, Hidden Power Dark confirmed super vs Ghosts/Psychics/Darks ~30-50% est., resists Ghost/Steel/Poison threats, weak to Fire/Fighting—watch switches; SD for potential physical coverage if needed later but prioritize special attacks). Damage notes: Scizor HP Dark ~35-50% on Dusclops (SpD -1 boosts this); Silver Wind ~20-30% neutral. Plan: Pressure Dusclops with HP Dark to chip/KO, if switches sac Gastly immediately after (Explosion/Thief/T-Bolt on abuser), use weakened Ariados as pivot if needed (Sludge Bomb vs Waters), then further setup Scizor (another Agility if safe or SD optional) for late sweep vs weakened team. Preserve Scizor health; win con: Eliminate Dusclops stall, sac vs abuser to reveal last mon, boosted Scizor sweeps endgame (outruns most post-+2 Spe). Monitor for Pain Split on switch (switch weakened Ariados to bait), Swagger mind games, or Skill Swap (Pressure on Scizor minor). Post-rain, opponent loses Water boosts—exploit with neutral/special coverage.\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent rain stall: Lombre (FNT, Rain setter), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/Recover/Pain Split/Swagger?; 66% HP, SpD -1; HP Dark super vs Ghost ~40-60% est. with debuff, aim to KO/chip heavily). Remaining: 2 slots (rain abuser e.g., Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra Water STAB now unboosted; + stall/setup e.g., Suicune/Mew/Deoxys). My team: Ariados (burned ~30%, sac pivot: Psychic/Sludge Bomb vs Ghosts/Grasses/Waters); Gastly (lvl5 full: Explosion sac vs setup/non-Ghost e.g., Groudon/Salamence/Mewtwo, Thief items on switches, T-Bolt/Giga Drain vs Waters/Grounds/Flyers); Gardevoir (FNT); Scizor (~84%, +2 Spe setup sweeper: Silver Wind special Bug STAB neutral ~20-30%, Hidden Power Dark super vs Ghosts/Psychics/Darks/Dragons? ~30-50%+, resists Ghost/Steel/Poison, weak Fire/Fighting—watch switches; Agility done, SD optional for physical if implied but focus special). Damage notes: Scizor HP Dark ~40-60% on Dusclops (potential KO); Silver Wind ~20-30% neutral. Plan: HP Dark to pressure/KO Dusclops, if survives/switch sac Gastly/Ariados immediately (Explosion/Thief/T-Bolt/Sludge Bomb on abuser), further setup Scizor (Agility+ if needed or SD) for late sweep vs weakened team. Preserve Scizor; win con: KO Dusclops, sac vs abuser to reveal last mon, boosted Scizor (+2 Spe outruns most) sweeps endgame. Monitor Pain Split/Swagger/Skill Swap (switch weakened Ariados to bait Split), post-rain neutralizes Water boosts—exploit with coverage/sacs.\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent rain stall: Lombre (FNT), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/Recover/Pain Split/Swagger?; ~51% HP pre-hit, SpD -1; HP Dark super vs Ghost ~40-60%+ est., high KO chance). Remaining: 2 slots (rain abuser e.g., Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra now unboosted; + stall/setup e.g., Suicune/Mew/Deoxys). My team: Ariados (burned ~30%, sac pivot: Psychic/Sludge Bomb vs Ghosts/Grasses/Waters); Gastly (lvl5 full: Explosion sac vs setup/non-Ghost e.g., Groudon/Salamence/Mewtwo, Thief items on switches, T-Bolt/Giga Drain vs Waters/Grounds/Flyers); Gardevoir (FNT); Scizor (~78%, +2 Spe: Silver Wind special Bug ~20-30% neutral, HP Dark super vs Ghosts/Psychics/Darks ~40-60%+, Agility maxed, SD optional but unnecessary—focus pressure/outspeed; resists Ghost/Steel/Poison, weak Fire/Fighting). Damage post-HP Dark: Predict KO Dusclops or <20% forcing Recover/switch. Plan: If KO/switch, next turn sac Gastly (Explosion/Thief/T-Bolt on abuser to reveal last mon and steal item/damage), use Ariados pivot if needed (Sludge Bomb vs Waters); if survives, follow with another HP Dark/Silver Wind to finish. Preserve Scizor for late sweep (+2 Spe outruns most Ubers, coverage hits Ghosts/Waters/Dragons). Win con: Remove Dusclops, sac vs abuser, boosted Scizor sweeps weakened endgame. Monitor Pain Split/Swagger (bait with Ariados if switch), post-rain exploits neutrals.\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent rain stall core disrupted: Lombre (FNT, Rain setter), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/Recover/Pain Split/Swagger?; switched out at ~45% HP, still alive and likely to return for stall), Poliwrath (Water/Fighting, male, LO, ability unknown—possibly Swift Swim but rain ended, moves unknown: predict Water STAB like Surf/Waterfall + Fighting like Dynamic Punch/Cross Chop; full HP). Remaining: 1 slot (final mon: likely stall/setup e.g., Suicune/Mew/Deoxys/Clamperl for bulk or Deoxys for speed). My team: Ariados (burned ~30%, sac pivot: Psychic/Sludge Bomb vs Ghosts/Grasses/Waters/Poisons); Gastly (lvl5 full: Explosion sac vs setup/non-Ghost e.g., Groudon/Salamence/Mewtwo/Poliwrath, Thief for items on switches like potential Scarf/LO, T-Bolt super vs Waters/Flyers/Grounds, Giga Drain vs Waters/Grasses); Gardevoir (FNT); Scizor (~84%, +2 Spe setup sweeper: Silver Wind special Bug STAB neutral ~20-30% on Poliwrath/Dusclops/Waters, Hidden Power Dark super vs Ghosts/Psychics/Darks ~40-60% but resisted/neutral on Waters/Fighting ~10-20%, Agility maxed, SD optional but irrelevant for special attacks; resists Water (0.25x? Wait, Steel resists Water 0.5x, Bug neutral), neutral to Fighting (super incoming risk but outspeed chips first); weak to Fire/Fighting—watch switches). Damage notes: Silver Wind ~20-30% neutral on Poliwrath (Spa 131 vs bulk ~200 SpD); follow-up could KO if low roll or force switch. Plan: Chip Poliwrath with Silver Wind now (outspeed attack before potential super-effective punch), if KO/switch sac Gastly immediately next turn (Explosion ~100% on full HP non-Ghost to reveal/damage last mon, or Thief/T-Bolt if Water switch), pivot weakened Ariados (Sludge Bomb super vs Poliwrath Water if returns) to bait Pain Split/Swagger from Dusclops; if Poliwrath stays, continue Silver Wind/HP Dark to pressure while tanking one hit (Scizor bulk ~236 Def/196 SpD handles ~30-50% from STABs). Preserve Scizor health for endgame sweep (+2 Spe outruns base 90-110 Ubers, neutral coverage chips weakened stall/abuser). Win con: Chip/KO Poliwrath, sac Gastly vs last mon to steal item/detonate, boosted Scizor mops up with repeated special attacks vs low-HP foes. Monitor for Poliwrath Hypnosis/Bulk Up setup (sac Gastly if boosts), or switches to Fire/Fighting threats (retreat to Ariados resists). Post-rain, exploit unboosted Waters with coverage/sacs.\n\nGen 3 Ubers opponent stall team: Lombre (FNT, Rain sac), Dusclops (Pressure/LO/WoW/Shadow Ball/Recover/Pain Split/Swagger?; ~45-51% HP, SpD -1; vulnerable to HP Dark super ~40-60%), Poliwrath (Water/Fighting male/LO/full moves unknown, likely Surf/Dynamic Punch/Hypnosis/Bulk Up; 97% HP, neutral to Scizor attacks ~20-30%), Dustox (Bug/Poison female/Shield Dust/LO/84% HP, moves unknown: likely special wall/Toxic/Protect/Butterfly Dance or Sludge Bomb/Psychic; weak to HP Dark super 2x ~30-50%, neutral to Silver Wind 1x ~20-30%). Remaining: 1 slot (likely rain abuser e.g., Kyogre/Swampert/Kingdra now unboosted post-rain, or another stall like Suicune/Mew). My team: Ariados (burned ~30%, sac pivot: Sludge Bomb super vs Poliwrath Waters/Grasses); Gastly (lvl5 full: Explosion sac vs setup/non-Ghost e.g., Mewtwo/Salamence/Poliwrath, Thief items on switches, T-Bolt super vs Waters/Flyers/Grounds incl. Poliwrath/Dustox, Giga Drain vs Waters); Gardevoir (FNT); Scizor (~90%, +2 Spe: Silver Wind special Bug STAB neutral ~20-30% on most, HP Dark super vs Ghosts (Dusclops)/Bugs (Dustox)/Psychics/Darks ~30-50%+, Agility maxed, SD optional/irrelevant for special focus; resists Bug/Poison/Steel/Water/Ghost, weak Fire/Fighting—avoid switches there). Damage notes: HP Dark ~35-50% on Dustox/Dusclops (potential KO on Dusclops), ~20-30% on Poliwrath; Silver Wind similar but weaker on Ghosts/Bugs. Plan: Pressure current Dustox with HP Dark (super, chip to force switch/KO), if switches to Poliwrath/Dusclops continue HP Dark for super/neutral chip while outspeeding/tanking (Scizor bulk handles Surf/Shadow Ball ~20-40%), sac Gastly next vs abuser/reveal last mon (Explosion/Thief/T-Bolt to damage/steal item), pivot Ariados (Sludge Bomb super on Poliwrath/Waters) to bait Pain Split/Swagger/Hypnosis safely. Preserve Scizor for endgame sweep (+2 Spe outruns base 90-130 Ubers, neutral/super coverage chips weakened foes). Win con: Chip/KO switches with Scizor, sac Gastly vs final abuser to reveal/detonate, boosted Scizor mops up stall remnants. Monitor for Dustox status/setup (Shield Dust neuters Sludge Bomb poison), Poliwrath Bulk Up (sac Gastly if boosts), or switches to Fire/Fighting (retreat to Ariados/Gastly resists).

Actions:\n{\n  \"moves\": [\n    \"rockslide\"\n  ],\n  \"switches\": [\n    \"medicham\",\n    \"blissey\"\n  ]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent: Groudon (Drought, sun active for ~4 more turns). Likely set: Swords Dance/EQ/Fire Blast/Dragon Claw or similar; physical or mixed. Preserve Medicham for revenge killing later due to CB lock-in risk. Shiftry strong in sun with instant Solar Beam (neutral on Groudon), but vulnerable to EQ; save for sweep if sun persists. Aerodactyl good vs Ground/Steel/Rock threats post-switch. Blissey for special walling, can TWave Groudon if needed. Overall strategy: Use sun synergy with Shiftry late-game, wallbreak with CB users (Medicham/Aero), stall with Blissey if necessary. Watch for opponent's switches; predict double-switch or sac plays.\n\nOpponent Groudon (Drought, sun active ~4 turns left). Used EQ, confirming physical set likely (Swords Dance/EQ/Stone Edge/Fire Punch?). Rock Slide should chunk ~40-50%; predict switch to Water/Grass/Ice resist (e.g., Kyogre/Swampert/Latias) – Medicham can revenge with Brick Break, Shiftry Solar Beam in sun. Aerodactyl locked into Rock Slide next turn if stays in. Watch for Deoxys or Rayquaza reveals. Long-term: Leverage sun for Shiftry sweep, use CB breakers to wallbreak, Blissey to pivot and status.\n\nOpponent Groudon: Physical set confirmed (EQ usage), Leftovers, Drought (sun up ~3 turns left). Likely moves: Swords Dance, EQ, Fire Punch (SE on Aero/Rock types), Dragon Claw/Stone Edge for coverage. Rock Slide chips ~16-20% per turn safely due to speed/immunity; aim to force SD or switch, then pivot if +2. Revealed opponent lead Medicham (switched out early, perhaps to scout or avoid sun weakness). My team synergy: Use Aero to soften Groudon, then Medicham CB Brick Break revenge (neutral on Ground, Pure Power boosts), Shiftry Chlorophyll sweep in sun (Solar Beam instant/strong neutral on Groudon), Blissey TWave/stall if Groudon sets up or for special threats. Watch for opponent switches to Water/Grass counters (e.g., Swampert, Venusaur); predict double switches. Long-term: Leverage sun for Shiftry, wallbreak with CB duo, status with Blissey. Damage tracking: Groudon ~90% now, next hit ~70-74% post-damage.\n\nSwitched to Shiftry on turn 4 vs. +2 Groudon (82% HP, physical set confirmed: EQ/SD/likely Fire Punch/Stone Edge). Solar Beam projected to chunk Groudon to ~30-40% or less; if KO, great momentum. If Groudon survives and EQs, Shiftry likely ~50-70% remaining based on bulk. Opponent may switch to Grass counter (e.g., Flying/Fire like Rayquaza or Moltres, or Poison like Crobat) or sac Groudon. Post-this, sun ~2-3 turns left; prioritize Shiftry sweep with instant Solar Beams/HP coverage while sun up, then pivot to CB breakers (Aero/Medicham) for physical threats. Blissey for TWave on fast sweepers or special walls (e.g., if Kyogre/Latias revealed). Revealed opponent: Medicham lead (likely CB physical), Groudon physical Drought. Watch for Deoxys (speed control), Rayquaza (setup), or Swampert (Water absorb). Team goals: Wallbreak with CB duo, sun sweep Shiftry, status/stall Blissey. Damage tracking: Groudon incoming Solar Beam ~40%+, total post-hit ~42% if no prior.\n\nShiftry fainted to presumed +2 Earthquake; team now at 3 Pokemon (Medicham CB Pure Power, Aerodactyl CB Rock Head, Blissey Leftovers Natural Cure). Opponent Groudon: physical Drought set (EQ/SD/Overheat/possible Stone Edge), 82% HP, +2 Atk, Leftovers, sun up ~3 turns. Switching to Aerodactyl: immune to EQ, outspeeds, CB Rock Slide chunks ~40% (total ~42% post-hit), Double Edge for neutral if needed, HP for coverage. Post-this, if Groudon low, pivot to Medicham Brick Break revenge (Pure Power x2 Atk devastating neutral). Preserve Blissey for special threats (e.g., Kyogre/Latias) or TWave on setup sweepers like Rayquaza/Deoxys. Opponent revealed: Medicham (early switch-out, likely CB physical), Aerodactyl (Rock Slide user). Likely remaining: Water/Grass counters (Swampert, Venusaur?) or Ubers (Kyogre, Rayquaza, Deoxys). Strategy: Wallbreak/chip Groudon with Aero speed tie-ins, revenge with Medicham CB, stall/status with Blissey, leverage remaining sun if Shiftry was meant for sweep but now focus CB duo pressure. Watch for double switches or sacs; damage tracking: Groudon to ~40-50% after Aero hit.\n\nUpdated damage tracking: Groudon at 88% HP (+2 Atk, -2 SpA, physical Drought set: EQ/SD/Overheat/likely Fire Punch/Dragon Claw/Stab moves; no Stone Edge in Gen 3). Double Edge projects ~50-60% damage, totaling ~28-38% remaining; follow-up with Medicham CB Brick Break (Pure Power x2, neutral but devastating ~80-100% KO potential). If Groudon attacks, likely EQ (0 damage) or Fire Punch (resisted, ~15-25% on Aero's bulk). Opponent switches possible to Aero counters (e.g., Swampert/Kyogre for Water, Zapdos/Latias for Electric/Ice). Sun ~3 turns left (benefits Fire moves but Shiftry dead, so neutral). Team status: Aerodactyl CB lead pressure, Medicham revenge killer for physical threats, Blissey special wall/TWave for setup sweepers (e.g., Rayquaza/Deoxys). Revealed opponent: Groudon physical, early Medicham switch-out (likely CB Pure Power physical). Likely remaining: Water/Ghost/Psychic Ubers (Kyogre, Latias, Deoxys, Rayquaza?). Strategy: Chip/wallbreak Groudon with Aero CB (EQ immune, DE/HP coverage), revenge with Medicham (Brick Break/SE coverage), pivot/stall with Blissey (Softboiled/Seismic Toss/Ice Beam/TWave). Watch for double switches or sacs; long-term win via CB pressure + status control.\n\nUpdated damage tracking: Groudon at 59% HP (+2 Atk, -2 SpA from Overheat, physical/mixed Drought set: EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch?/Stone Edge?/Dragon Claw?; Leftovers). Double-Edge projects ~35% damage, leaving ~24%; recoil ~9% on Aerodactyl (to ~91%). Post-this, switch to Medicham CB Brick Break for KO (Pure Power x2 Atk + CB ~devastating neutral damage). If Groudon switches, assess: Medicham covers most (Brick Break SE on Normals/Darks, Shadow Ball for Ghosts/Psychics, Rock Slide for Fires/Flying). Preserve Blissey for special threats (e.g., Kyogre/Latias special attacks, TWave on Rayquaza/Deoxys setup). Sun ~2 turns left (boosts Fire moves, watch for opponent's Fire coverage). Revealed opponent: Groudon physical/mixed, early Medicham switch-out (likely CB Pure Power physical). Likely remaining: Water (Swampert/Kyogre), Psychic (Latias/Deoxys), Dragon (Rayquaza), or walls (Snorlax/Tyranitar). Strategy: Finish Groudon with CB Medicham revenge, then pressure with Aerodactyl CB (EQ immune to Grounds, Double-Edge neutral pressure, Rock Slide SE on Fires/Flying), pivot/stall with Blissey (Softboiled recovery, Seismic Toss fixed damage, Ice Beam coverage, TWave speed control). Watch for double switches or sacs; long-term win via CB wallbreaking duo + status/stall.\n\nSwampert revealed: Leftovers, Torrent, bulky Water/Ground set (likely EQ/Surf/Ice Beam/Protect or CB physical); switched into predicted Double Edge on turn 6, confirming defensive role to wall or counter Ground/Steel threats like Groudon. KO'd on turn 7 with CB Double Edge, gaining momentum. Opponent's Groudon: physical/mixed Drought set (EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch?/coverage), ~59% HP remaining, +2 Atk, -2 SpA, Leftovers; vulnerable to Medicham CB Brick Break revenge (~80-100% KO potential with Pure Power). Sun active for ~2 more turns (boosts Fire/Solar but Shiftry dead, so aids opponent's Fire coverage if any). My team: 3 left (Aerodactyl CB full HP locked to Double Edge - switch out next to reset; Medicham CB full for physical revenge/wallbreaking; Blissey full for special walling/TWave on setup sweepers like Rayquaza/Deoxys). Likely opponent remaining: 2 Ubers (possible Kyogre/Latias for special Water/Dragon, Deoxys for speed/setup, Rayquaza for mixed sweeping, or Snorlax/Tyranitar walls). Strategy post-KO: If opponent sends physical threat, stay in with Double Edge (neutral on most) or switch to Medicham Brick Break. For special threats, pivot to Blissey (TWave/Ice Beam/Seismic Toss). Long-term: Use CB duo (Aero/Medicham) to wallbreak, Blissey to stall/status and preserve health. Watch for double switches, sacs, or setup attempts; damage tracking: Groudon at 59%, next threats unknown but prepare for Water/Psychic/Dragon matchups. Leverage any remaining sun neutrally.\n\nGengar revealed: Full HP, Levitate (immune to Ground/EQ), likely special attacker set (Shadow Ball/Sludge Bomb/Thunderbolt/Destiny Bond/Hypnosis or Ice Punch for coverage; frail but speedy). Immune to Normal/Fighting moves, weak to Ghost/Dark/Psychic/Ground (but Levitate). Switched in after Swampert KO, possibly to counter physical threats or Destiny Bond sac. Damage tracking: Opponent Groudon still at 59% HP (+2 Atk, -2 SpA, Leftovers, physical/mixed Drought: EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch/coverage), Swampert FNT, Medicham early switch-out (likely CB Pure Power physical unused). Likely remaining opponent: 1 more (possible Kyogre/Latias special walls, Deoxys speed/setup, Rayquaza mixed sweeper, Snorlax/Tyranitar physical wall). My team: Aerodactyl CB full HP locked to Double Edge (reset on switch), Medicham CB full for revenge on Groudon/physicals (Brick Break ~KO on 59% Groudon), Blissey full for special walling/TWave on Gengar/setup threats (Seismic Toss chip, Ice Beam coverage, Softboiled sustain). Sun ~1-2 turns left (boosts Fire moves, watch opponent's Fire coverage on Groudon). Strategy: Blissey in to tank special, TWave Gengar next (paralyze for speed control), chip with Seismic Toss, then pivot to Medicham CB Brick Break KO Groudon if it comes back in. Use Aerodactyl CB pressure post-reset (Rock Slide SE on potential Fires/Flyings, Double Edge neutral, EQ for Grounds if unlocked, HP coverage). Long-term: Wallbreak with CB duo (Medicham/Aerodactyl), status/stall with Blissey, finish remaining threats via type advantages and paralysis. Watch for Destiny Bond (avoid overcommitting), double switches, or setup attempts; prepare for final Uber reveal (e.g., special Water/Dragon needs Blissey, physical needs Medicham).\n\nCurrent state: Turn 9, my Blissey (87% HP, burned? Wait, input shows burned but log burned opponent's Blissey—assume my Blissey full/healthy per team status inconsistencies, but proceed as tank). Vs opponent Gengar (100% HP, Levitate, special attacker likely Shadow Ball/Sludge Bomb/TBolt/Destiny Bond; immune to Seismic Toss). Opponent team: Groudon (59% HP, +2 Atk -2 SpA, physical/mixed Drought Leftovers: EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch/coverage), Swampert FNT (bulky Water/Ground), Gengar active, early Medicham (likely CB Pure Power physical unused), 1 unknown remaining (possible Kyogre/Latias special, Deoxys speed, Rayquaza mixed, Snorlax/Tyranitar wall). My team: Medicham CB full (Pure Power x2 Atk: Brick Break revenge KO on Groudon, Shadow Ball for Ghosts/Psychics, Rock Slide coverage), Aerodactyl CB full (locked to Double Edge? reset on switch: Rock Slide SE Fires/Flying, DE neutral, EQ Grounds, HP coverage), Blissey full (Natural Cure, Leftovers: Softboiled sustain, Ice Beam coverage vs Dragons/grounds, TWave speed control, Seismic Toss fixed chip on non-Ghosts). Shiftry FNT. Sun ~1 turn left (boosts Fire, watch Groudon Fire Punch). Strategy: TWave Gengar this turn for para/speed tie, then Ice Beam chip (~50% projected, KO next if para'd). If Gengar Destiny Bonds, avoid overkill—switch to Medicham Shadow Ball if needed post-para. Post-Gengar: Revenge Groudon with Medicham CB Brick Break (~KO at 59%). For final threat: Blissey walls special (TWave/Ice Beam/Seismic Toss), CB duo pressures physical/mixed. Watch for double switches, sacs, or setup (para mitigates Rayquaza/Deoxys). Damage tracking: Gengar incoming TWave then Ice Beam ~50%, Groudon 59% vulnerable to Medicham. Long-term: Status control with Blissey, wallbreak with CB Medicham/Aerodactyl, leverage type matchups for win.\n\nTeam: Medicham CB Pure Power (full, switch in to revenge/chunk Gengar or Groudon), Aerodactyl CB Rock Head (full, for EQ immunity vs Groudon or speed pressure), Blissey Leftovers Natural Cure (69% BRN, switching out to cure; Ice Beam/Seismic Toss/TWave for special threats/setup control), Shiftry FNT. Opponent: Groudon (~59% +2 Atk -2 SpA Leftovers Drought physical/mixed: EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch/coverage; sun ~1 turn left), Swampert FNT (bulky Water/Ground), Gengar (100% PAR Levitate: Wisp/Thunderbolt/Shadow Ball?/Sludge Bomb?; likely special frail), 1 unknown (predict special wall like Latias/Kyogre, setup Rayquaza/Deoxys, or physical Snorlax/Tyranitar). Post-switch: Medicham vs Gengar (Rock Slide ~75% chunk, lock in) or vs Groudon (survive EQ ~30% HP, Brick Break ~40% chip). If Gengar chunked low, finish with follow-up. Preserve Blissey for final mon (TWave speed control on Rayquaza/Deoxys, Ice Beam Dragons/Grounds, stall specials, Seismic Toss chip). Aerodactyl for post-Groudon cleanup (immune EQ, Double Edge neutral pressure). Long-term: Leverage CB Medicham/Aerodactyl wallbreaking power, Blissey status/stall to outlast; predict final reveal and position accordingly (e.g., Blissey in vs special Uber). Damage tracking: Groudon 59%, Gengar incoming ~75% if stays; Medicham post-EQ ~30% if switched.\n\nUpdated state (turn 11): My team - Medicham CB Pure Power 54% HP active (Brick Break OHKO on Gengar, locked in post-this; revenge killer for Groudon/their Medicham), Aerodactyl CB Rock Head full HP (switch for EQ immunity vs Groudon, Rock Slide SE on Fires/Flyings, Double Edge neutral pressure), Blissey Leftovers Natural Cure 69% HP healthy now (post-switch cure; TWave for speed control on remaining threats like Rayquaza/Deoxys, Ice Beam coverage vs Dragons/Grounds, Seismic Toss chip, Softboiled sustain). Shiftry/Swampert? FNT. Opponent: Gengar full PAR incoming OHKO (Levitate special attacker: Shadow Ball/Sludge Bomb/Thunderbolt/Wisp/Destiny Bond?; frail, watch for sac Bond), Groudon ~59% +2 Atk -2 SpA Leftovers Drought physical/mixed (EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch/coverage; sun ending soon, vulnerable to Brick Break ~KO), their Medicham 54% Pure Power CB male (likely physical: Brick Break/Shadow Ball/Rock Slide/Fake Out; switch risk), Swampert FNT bulky Water/Ground, Blissey ~69% post-damage/cure (wall with Softboiled/Seismic Toss/Ice Beam/TWave; burned earlier but cured). Sun ~1 turn left (boosts Fire moves minimally now). Likely no more reveals, 3v3 but opponent has 4? Wait, 4 remaining? Early Aerodactyl? Revealed: Gengar, Groudon, Swampert, their Medicham, Blissey – perhaps 5 total, 1 FNT? Focus 2v3 post-Gengar. Strategy: OHKO Gengar with Brick Break to gain momentum, then use locked Medicham to pressure switches (KO Groudon if sent, chunk their Medicham/Blissey). If switch to Groudon, Brick Break chips low; follow with Aerodactyl Rock Slide/Double Edge cleanup. Switch to Blissey vs special threats (TWave their Medicham for para control, Ice Beam Groudon if needed). Long-term: Wallbreak with CB duo (Medicham Brick Break lock versatile neutral/SE, Aerodactyl coverage), stall/status with Blissey to outlast; predict opponent sacs Gengar or double-switches to Groudon/their Medicham. Damage: Gengar to 0, Groudon 59% vulnerable, their Medicham 54% chunkable. Watch Destiny Bond (switch if suspected), setup attempts (TWave mitigates). Win via type matchups and paralysis control.\n\nCurrent state (turn 12): My team - Medicham CB Pure Power 9% HP locked to Brick Break (preserve for revenge KO on Groudon ~59% with neutral Brick Break under Pure Power x2 Atk + CB; versatile vs Darks/Normals, but ineffective vs Ghosts like Gengar), Aerodactyl CB Rock Head 100% (EQ immune vs Groudon, fast pressure with Rock Slide SE on potential Fires/Flyings or Double Edge neutral STAB, HP coverage), Blissey Leftovers Natural Cure 69% switching in (special wall: Softboiled sustain, Seismic Toss 100 fixed chip on Gengar ~30%, Ice Beam neutral coverage vs Dragons/Grounds/Flyings, Thunder Wave redundant but for future switches). Shiftry FNT. Opponent: Gengar 100% PAR Levitate special attacker (revealed moves: Will-O-Wisp status, Thunderbolt special Electric; likely has Shadow Ball STAB Ghost, Sludge Bomb Poison STAB/coverage, Destiny Bond sac potential; frail bulk, weak to ? but immune Fighting/Ground/Normal; para already slows to 25% Speed, outspeed controllable). Groudon ~59% +2 Atk -2 SpA Leftovers Drought physical/mixed set (EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch/coverage; sun ending ~0-1 turns, boosts Fire moves minimally now; vulnerable to Medicham Brick Break KO). Swampert FNT (bulky Water/Ground defensive). Likely remaining opponent mons: Based on log, possibly more like Deoxys/Rayquaza for setup/speed, or walls (Snorlax/Tyranitar), but focus on revealed. Opponent's early mons: Aerodactyl (physical CB? Rock Slide/Double-Edge/EQ? full HP likely, Rock Head no recoil), but switched out. Strategy: Blissey tanks Gengar's hit this turn, then outspeeds para Gengar next turn to chip with Seismic Toss (reliable damage without type reliance) or Ice Beam (possible freeze/secondary para). Avoid overcommitting if Destiny Bond suspected (switch to Aerodactyl Double Edge neutral if needed, but unlikely). Post-Gengar weakened/chip, predict switch to Groudon - revenge with Medicham Brick Break (projected KO at 59% with boosts). If opponent switches to physical threat (e.g., their Aerodactyl), stay Blissey Seismic Toss chip or pivot to Medicham Brick Break SE. Use Aerodactyl post-Groudon for cleanup (speed advantage, immune to EQ, coverage vs remaining). Long-term win: Stall/chip Gengar with Blissey while preserving CB wallbreakers (Medicham for Fighting coverage on Groudon/Steels/Normals, Aerodactyl for Rock/Flying/Ground matchups). Watch for double switches, Destiny Bond sacs, or setup attempts on weakened Gengar (though para limits). Damage tracking: Gengar incoming Seismic Toss ~30%, Groudon 59% vulnerable to ~100% from Medicham. Weather: Sunny Day ending, neutralizes special Water but irrelevant now. Overall: Leverage Blissey's bulk for safe positioning, CB duo for wallbreaking, status/speed control to outpace and outlast.\n\nCurrent damage tracking: My Blissey 65% (tanks special, heal later), Medicham 9% (preserve for revenge KO on Groudon 59% with CB Brick Break ~OHKO neutral via Pure Power x2), Aerodactyl 100% incoming switch (tanks Gengar hit ~30%, then OHKO Gengar with CB Rock Slide neutral STAB; coverage: Double-Edge neutral pressure, EQ for Grounds like opponent Groudon, Rock Slide SE on Fires/Flyings/Blissey). Shiftry FNT. Opponent: Gengar 100% PAR (Levitate special frail: Wisp/TBolt/Shadow Ball?/Sludge Bomb?/Destiny Bond sac?; incoming ~100% KO post-switch), Groudon ~59% +2 Atk -2 SpA Leftovers Drought physical/mixed (EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch/coverage; vulnerable to Medicham Brick Break KO or Aerodactyl EQ post-lock), Swampert FNT (bulky Water/Ground), their Medicham ~9% (from earlier 24/262, Pure Power CB physical: Brick Break/Shadow Ball/Rock Slide/Fake Out; low HP, easy cleanup), their Aerodactyl full (CB Rock Head physical: Rock Slide/Double-Edge/EQ/HP; potential threat but vengeable with Blissey Ice Beam/TWave or Medicham Shadow Ball), their Blissey ~65% (Natural Cure Leftovers special wall: Softboiled/Ice Beam/Seismic Toss/TWave; walls CB physical but chunked by Aerodactyl Rock Slide ~50%+). Likely 1 more unknown (predict setup sweeper like Rayquaza/Deoxys/Latias for special/dragon/psychic threats - TWave with Blissey, Ice Beam coverage). Sun ending this turn (no major impact post-Shiftry FNT). Revealed opponent set: 6 mons with sun synergy (Groudon Drought), physical CB focus (Medicham/Aerodactyl), special wall (Blissey), bulky pivot (Swampert), frail special (Gengar). Strategy post-Gengar KO: Pressure switches with Aerodactyl CB (Rock Slide chunks Blissey/Medicham/Aerodactyl, EQ KOs low Groudon if sent, Double-Edge neutral on walls), revenge with Medicham Brick Break (OHKO Groudon, SE on Blissey/Aerodactyl), pivot to Blissey vs special (TWave Rayquaza/Deoxys for para control, Ice Beam SE on ? Dragons/Grounds/Flyings, Seismic Toss chip non-Ghosts, Softboiled sustain). Watch for Destiny Bond sac on Gengar (low risk on switch), double-switches to Groudon/Blissey, or final Uber reveal (position Blissey in for special/setup). Long-term win: Momentum from Gengar KO -> wallbreak with CB duo (Medicham Fighting coverage on Normals/Steels/Darks/Rocks, Aerodactyl Rock/Flying/Ground pressure) -> stall/status final threats with Blissey bulk to outlast 3v4 but leverage type advantages and low opponent HP (Groudon 59%, Medicham 9%). No setup risks post-para control.\n\nOpponent revealed Tyranitar (full HP, Sand Stream activated - weather now Sandstorm for 13 turns, benefits Rock/Ground/Steel types like Tyranitar itself; item unknown, likely physical set: Dragon Dance/Crunch/Stone Edge/EQ/Pursuit or tanky with Leftovers; weak to Fighting 2x, take SE Rock Slide). Opponent's overall team: Groudon (~59% +2 Atk -2 SpA physical/mixed Drought Leftovers: EQ/SD/Overheat/Fire Punch/coverage; revenge with Medicham Brick Break ~OHKO neutral via Pure Power x2 + CB), Swampert FNT (bulky Water/Ground), Gengar (full HP PAR Levitate special frail: Will-O-Wisp/Thunderbolt/Shadow Ball/Sludge Bomb/Destiny Bond?; revenge with Aerodactyl Double-Edge ~OHKO neutral or Medicham Shadow Ball if locked), their Medicham (9% HP Pure Power CB physical male: Brick Break/Shadow Ball/Rock Slide/Fake Out; easy cleanup with any attack), their Aerodactyl (full HP CB Rock Head physical: Rock Slide/Double-Edge/EQ/HP; counter with Blissey Ice Beam/TWave or Medicham Shadow Ball, immune to EQ but weak to Rock 4x - avoid), their Blissey (~65% Natural Cure Leftovers special wall: Softboiled/Ice Beam/Seismic Toss/Thunder Wave; chunk with Aerodactyl Rock Slide ~50%+ SE, revenge Medicham Brick Break SE). Likely no more mons or 1 unknown (predict minor like Snorlax if 6 total). My team: Aerodactyl CB Rock Head 100% active (outspeeds most, EQ immune vs Groudon/their Aerodactyl, Rock Slide SE on Tyranitar/Blissey/Aerodactyl/Fires, Double-Edge neutral pressure, HP Dark coverage vs Psychics/Ghosts; locked post-Rock Slide but versatile), Medicham CB Pure Power 9% (preserve low HP for revenge kills: Brick Break OHKO Groudon/Tyranitar/Blissey neutral/SE, Shadow Ball on Gengar/Psychics, Rock Slide on Fires/Flyings; switch in safely post-chunk), Blissey Leftovers Natural Cure 65% (special/physical wall: Softboiled sustain, Seismic Toss 100 fixed chip on non-Ghosts ~20-30%, Ice Beam coverage vs Tyranitar (neutral)/Dragons/Grounds/Flyings (SE), Thunder Wave speed control on remaining fast threats like their Aerodactyl or unknown setup). Shiftry FNT. Weather: Sandstorm chips Flying/Rock like Aerodactyl (~6% per turn) but halves on Rock typing; benefits Tyranitar bulk. Strategy: Chunk Tyranitar with CB Rock Slide (~60% damage, leaves ~40%; forces switch or DD attempt - if switches to low HP like Groudon/Medicham, follow with locked Rock Slide which chunks/neutralizes), then revenge low threats with Medicham (Brick Break priority on physical switch-ins) or pivot to Blissey vs special (TWave their Aerodactyl for para, Ice Beam chip Tyranitar/Grounds). Post-Tyranitar: Clean Gengar with Aerodactyl Double-Edge if unlocked or Medicham Shadow Ball, OHKO Groudon with Medicham Brick Break, cleanup low Medicham/Blissey/Aerodactyl via type advantages (Rock Slide SE on Blissey/Aerodactyl, Brick Break SE on Tyranitar). Watch for Tyranitar Pursuit on switch (but Aerodactyl stays in), double-switches to Groudon (EQ immune), or Destiny Bond on Gengar (avoid overkill). Long-term win: 3v~5 but opponent spread thin with low HP mons - leverage Aerodactyl speed/CB pressure to chunk switches, Medicham revenge kills on weakened physicals (Groudon/Tyranitar), Blissey stall/chip/status final threats (TWave fast mons, Ice Beam coverage) to outlast via momentum and type matchups. Damage projections: Tyranitar post-Rock Slide ~40%, Groudon 59% ->0 by Medicham, their Medicham 9% ->0 easy, Blissey 65% chunkable to low. Preserve Medicham HP by switching post-chunk if possible."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Failed to parse response", "action": null}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

Intimidate). Possible moves: Dragon Dance, Waterfall/Hydro Pump, Earthquake, Thrash/Outrage. Item unknown, possibly Leftovers or Life Orb equivalent. Burn applied turn 1 to halve Attack. Opponent may switch to a Ground-type to avoid Electric moves or a special attacker. My Gengar is special attacker, frail but fast. Heracross (Guts): Physical powerhouse, weak to Flying/Psychic, good vs Dark/Rock. My Gyarados: DD physical, similar to opponent's. Kecleon: Color Change Choice Band, utility/trick potential but slow. Overall strategy: Use Gengar to status and chip leads, pivot to Heracross for revenge kills, save sweepers for late game. Watch for common Ubers threats like Kyogre, Groudon not seen yet.\n\nOpponent's Kyogre: Revealed, Drizzle (confirmed), item unknown (likely Choice Specs or Leftovers for special sweeping; moves likely Water Spout/Surf/Thunder/Ice Beam). Burned at 88%, rain active (4 turns left post-this). Thunderbolt should chunk it hard; if it survives, prepare for Follow Me or switch bait. Gengar frail, so avoid staying in vs predicted strong Water hit. Heracross Guts setup potential vs weakened Kyogre if needed. Opponent's Gyarados Intimidate confirmed, likely DD sweeper. Team threats: Watch for Mewtwo/Deoxys/Groudon not revealed. Long-term: Status with Gengar, sweep with Heracross/Gyarados late-game, Kecleon for trick/utility. Damage preds: Thunderbolt ~50-70% to Kyogre.\n\nOpponent's Mantine: Likely defensive pivot (Water Absorb or Swift Swim possible in Gen 3 Ubers), but at low HP (38%) and vulnerable to repeated Thunderbolts. Previous Thunderbolt dealt ~62% in rain; expect KO this turn if no switch. Opponent's Kyogre: Burned at 88%, Drizzle active (rain ~3 turns left including this). Thunderbolt predicts ~50-70% damage if switched in—could drop it low or KO if predicted accurately. Watch for switch to Gyarados (Intimidate DD sweeper, full HP), which resists Electric but weak to future plays. My team intact at 100%; Gengar healthy but -1 Atk (irrelevant for special moves). Post-KO, pivot to Heracross for physical threats or keep Gengar for status/chip. Long-term: Burn more foes with Gengar, setup sweep with Gyarados/Heracross (Guts if status baited), use Kecleon Choice Band Trick for item disruption if needed. Potential threats: Opponent may have Deoxys/Mewtwo/Latias unrevealed—preserve Gengar for Ghost immunity. Damage calcs: Confirm Thunderbolt vs. Kyogre ~60% neutral in rain boost.\n\nUpdated opponent's team: Swampert targeted for burn this turn—assume physical set (EQ/Waterfall/Ice Punch likely), will be crippled offensively + passive damage. Mantine at 38% (super weak to Tbolt, ~OHKO in rain; likely Leftovers/Water Absorb/Swift Swim defensive pivot). Kyogre burned at 88% (Drizzle special sweeper, moves probably Water Spout/Surf/Thunder/Ice Beam; burn only chips HP, doesn't nerf SpA in Gen 3). Gyarados full HP (Intimidate DD physical sweeper, Water/Flying; resists Electric/Water). Unrevealed: Possible 4th mon like Deoxys/Mewtwo/Groudon/Latias—watch for setup/speed control. My team full HP, intact. Rain from Drizzle: Started turn 1, upkeeps turns 2-4, so ~2 turns left (ends after turn 6 upkeep). Post-burn, pivot Gengar to chip/status leads; revenge with Heracross (Guts vs. weakened physicals, Megahorn on Kyogre/Gyarados). Setup Gyarados DD late-game vs. rain-weakened foes. Kecleon Band Return for Trick on specs users or punch holes. Damage preds: Tbolt vs. Mantine ~70-90% (prior hit 68%, same conditions); vs. Kyogre ~55-65% neutral in rain (SpD ~140 base). Avoid overextending Gengar (frail to Water/Psychic). Win con: Status chip with Gengar, sweep with boosted Heracross/Gyarados.\n\nUpdated opponent's Swampert: Uses Hydro Pump (special Water in Gen 3, rain-boosted), suggesting mixed or special set; likely has Earthquake (physical coverage, immune to my Electric), Waterfall (physical STAB), Ice Punch/Beam (coverage). Burn provides passive damage but doesn't halve special power. Damage pred: Hydro Pump ~65% to frail foes like Gengar; ~40-50% to Heracross (neutral, bulky SpD). Opponent's Mantine at 38% (Water/Flying pivot, likely Water Absorb/Swift Swim/Leftovers); Rock Slide 2x super effective for KO if switched in. Kyogre burned 88% (Drizzle special sweeper, Specs/Leftovers likely, moves: Water Spout/Surf/Thunder/Ice Beam); Megahorn neutral but chunks ~50-60% with Heracross Atk. Gyarados full HP (Intimidate DD physical Water/Flying sweeper, moves: DD/Waterfall/EQ/Outrage); weak to Rock Slide (4x). Unrevealed 4th mon: Likely Deoxys/Mewtwo/Groudon/Latias—monitor for speed/setup. My team full HP except Gengar 41%; rain active (~2-3 turns left, ends soon, Drizzle resets if Kyogre back in). Post-switch, use Heracross to revenge/chip physical threats, bait status for Guts activation, or SD if safe. Preserve Gengar for WoW on physical sweepers (e.g., enemy's Gyarados/Swampert). Gyarados for late DD sweep in rain (boosts Water moves if any, but physical focus). Kecleon Band Return/Trick for utility vs walls/specs (e.g., Trick on Kyogre). Win con: Chip with status/pivots early, sweep with boosted Heracross (Guts)/Gyarados late; avoid overcommitting Gengar vs predicted Water/Psychic hits.\n\nOpponent's Swampert: Mixed set likely (Hydro Pump special Water, possibly Earthquake physical Ground, Ice Punch coverage; Thunderbolt? Not confirmed on it, but team has Electric via Gengar). Damage pred: Megahorn ~70-90% with Atk 383 vs. assumed bulky Def (base 90); if survives, follow with SD or Rock Slide. Mantine at 38% (defensive Water/Flying pivot, likely Water Absorb/Swift Swim/Leftovers; Rock Slide OHKO). Kyogre burned 88% (Drizzle special sweeper; Megahorn ~50-60% neutral chunk). Gyarados full HP (Intimidate DD physical Water/Flying; weak to Rock Slide 4x, resists Water/Ground). Unrevealed 4th: Deoxys/Mewtwo/Groudon/Latias possible—Gengar for Ghost immunity/status. My team: Heracross active full, Gengar 41% (status/chip role), Gyarados/Kecleon full (DD sweep/Trick utility). Rain ends after turn 6. Win con: Pressure Swampert with Megahorn, revenge switches with Rock Slide (Mantine/Gyarados), burn physicals with Gengar WoW, late sweep boosted Heracross (Guts if statused)/Gyarados DD. Watch switches to Kyogre (burn chips it, but strong Water/Thunder) or unrevealed setups.\n\nKO'd Swampert with Megahorn—opponent down to 3, sends unrevealed 4th mon (probable Deoxys speed control, Mewtwo special setup, Groudon sun/setup, or Latias defensive pivot; prepare Rock Slide for potential Flying/4x Gyarados revenge, or switch Gengar if Psychic/Fighting predicted). Heracross now at ~70-80% post-any chip/Leftovers. Rain ends after this upkeep (Drizzle gone unless Kyogre switches back). Opponent threats: Kyogre (88% burned, special Water/Thunder danger to Heracross/Gengar, but chunkable with Megahorn ~50-60%); Mantine (38%, OHKO with Rock Slide 2x); Gyarados (full, DD physical, weak to Rock Slide 4x, burn it with Gengar WoW to cripple). My positioning: Keep Heracross in for physical matchups/revenge (Guts bait status), switch to Gyarados DD vs weakened specials/walls, Gengar for WoW on sweepers + Tbolt coverage, Kecleon Band Trick on bulky specs (e.g., Kyogre) or Return punch holes. Win con: Momentum from KO, status physicals early, late sweep with +1/+2 Heracross (SD if safe) or Gyarados DD exploiting rain-weakened foes before drought potential. Damage calcs: Confirm Megahorn vs remaining: ~80-100% Kyogre, ~90-110% Mantine, ~100-120% Gyarados.\n\nSwampert at 20% KO'd via switch to Gyarados + EQ; opponent's team now 3 Pokémon (Kyogre 88% burned Drizzle special sweeper, Mantine 38% defensive pivot OHKOable by Rock Slide, Gyarados full Intimidate DD physical sweeper 4x weak to Rock Slide, unrevealed 4th likely Deoxys/Mewtwo/Groudon/Latias for speed/setup/sun). Heracross frozen (thaws 20% per turn, preserve for Guts activation via status bait + Megahorn revenge on Waters/Bugs; ~63% HP safe via switch). Gyarados incoming full HP for momentum/setup (DD vs weakened specials/walls post-rain end; EQ coverage on Grounds/Electrics/Poisons like potential Deoxys). Gengar 41% for WoW on physical sweepers (enemy Gyarados/Swampert crippled by burn if reapplied, Tbolt on Waters). Kecleon full Choice Band for Return punch/Trick on specs walls (e.g., Kyogre to disrupt). Rain ends after this turn (no active Drizzle). Win con: Eliminate low-HP threats early (Mantine/Kyogre next), status physicals with Gengar WoW, setup sweep with +Gyarados DD or Heracross SD/Guts (bait burn on Heracross for 1.5x Atk), use Kecleon to Trick items and break stalls. Threats: Watch Kyogre switch-in (chunk with Megahorn/Tbolt ~50-60%, burn chips it); enemy Gyarados DD (burn/WoW + Rock Slide 4x); unrevealed setups (Gengar Ghost immunity, Heracross Fighting for Darks/Poisons). Damage calcs: Gyarados EQ vs Swampert ~120-140% super; Heracross Megahorn vs Kyogre ~60-80% neutral; Rock Slide vs enemy Gyarados ~100-130% 4x.\n\nKO'd Swampert via Double Edge—opponent now at 3 Pokémon: full-HP Gyarados (Intimidate DD physical sweeper, Water/Flying; neutral to Earthquake, but Intimidate on switch; plan DD + Double Edge/HP Dark after Intimidate). Kyogre (88% burned, Drizzle special Water/Thunder sweeper; Earthquake neutral ~50-60% chunk, avoids Water weakness; rain resets if sent but burn chips 12.5%/turn). Mantine (38% defensive Water/Flying pivot, likely Water Absorb/Swift Swim; Earthquake 2x super ~OHKO). All opponent team revealed (Gyarados, Kyogre, Mantine, Swampert KO'd); no unrevealed threats. My team intact: Gyarados active ~86% (DD physical sweeper, Intimidate for -1 opp Atk on switches; ideal late-game after chips). Heracross frozen 63% (thaws soon, Guts Megahorn revenge on Waters/Bugs; SD if safe). Gengar 41% (WoW physicals like opp Gyarados, Tbolt Waters). Kecleon 100% Choice Band (Return punch neutrals, Trick on specs Kyogre to cripple). Rain ends after this upkeep (no Drizzle active). Win con: KO low threats (Mantine next if sent), status opp Gyarados with Gengar WoW on switch prediction, setup DD on Gyarados vs weakened Kyogre/Mantine, then sweep with +Spe/Atk. Bait Intimidate switches to neuter physicals. Damage calcs: Double Edge vs Swampert ~100%+ neutral; Earthquake vs opp Gyarados ~40-50%, vs Mantine ~80-100% 2x, vs Kyogre ~50-60% neutral. Preserve Gyarados for clean sweeps, use Heracross Guts vs any status bait.\n\nKO'd Swampert earlier; opponent now at 3 Pokémon: Kyogre 44% burned (Drizzle special Water/Thunder sweeper, likely Water Spout/Surf/Thunder/Ice Beam; Earthquake ~50-60% neutral, Thunder super on my Gyarados but survivable). Mantine 38% (defensive Water/Flying pivot, Water Absorb/Swift Swim probable; Earthquake 2x ~OHKO). Gyarados full HP (Intimidate DD physical Water/Flying sweeper; Earthquake ~40-50% neutral, 4x weak to potential Rock Slide revenge from Heracross). All opponent team revealed, no hidden threats. My team: Gyarados active 77% (DD physical sweeper with Intimidate utility; Earthquake coverage on Waters/Electrics/Poisons, Double Edge for neutrals, HP Dark for Psychics/Ghosts if needed). Heracross frozen 63% (thaws soon; Guts Megahorn for Waters/Bugs revenge, SD setup). Gengar 41% (WoW on physical sweepers like opp Gyarados, Thunderbolt on Waters ~50-70% in rain). Kecleon 100% Choice Band (Return neutral punches, Trick on bulky specs like potential Kyogre follow-up). Rain active this turn but ends post-upkeep (resets on Kyogre re-entry). Win con: KO Kyogre with Earthquake for momentum, then OHKO Mantine with follow-up Earthquake; status opp Gyarados with Gengar WoW on predicted switch (cripple DD), setup DD on Gyarados vs weakened remnants, or SD Heracross (Guts if status baited) for late sweep. Use Kecleon Trick to disrupt any remaining bulky threats. Preserve Gyarados for clean sweeps post-chips; avoid overexposing Gengar to strong Waters/Thunders. Damage calcs: Earthquake vs Kyogre ~50-60% (KO at 44%); vs Mantine ~80-100% 2x; vs opp Gyarados ~40-50% neutral. If Kyogre survives, next turn DD + Earthquake/HP Dark to finish while outspeeding.\n\nKO'd opponent's Swampert earlier; now Gyarados fainted (turn 10 details unclear, but state confirms). Opponent at 3 Pokémon: Kyogre ~10-44% burned (Drizzle special Water/Thunder sweeper, Leftovers; Water Spout/Surf/Thunder/Ice Beam likely—weak at low HP, easy OHKO with Kecleon Return). Mantine 38% (Water/Flying pivot, Water Absorb/Swift Swim; Earthquake/Return ~OHKO 2x/neutral). Opponent's Gyarados full HP (Intimidate DD physical Water/Flying; weak to Rock Slide 4x from Heracross, burn with Gengar WoW to halve Atk). Opponent's Gengar ~41% (special statuser, Levitate; avoid Ground, but Tbolt revenge if needed). All opponent team revealed. My team: Kecleon switching in 100% Choice Band (bulky physical breaker, Return for neutrals, Trick for utility vs walls/specs; locked after use). Gengar 41% (WoW priority on physical switches like opp Gyarados, Tbolt Waters ~50-70%, Ice Punch coverage; frail, preserve for status). Heracross 63% frozen (thaws ~20% next turn; Guts Megahorn revenge on Waters/Bugs ~60-80%, Rock Slide on Flying 2-4x, SD setup if safe). Rain ends post-this upkeep. Win con: OHKO Kyogre with Kecleon Return (tanks hit safely), then switch Gengar to WoW incoming opp Gyarados/Mantine on prediction (cripple physicals), revenge low-HP Mantine with Heracross Rock Slide or Kecleon Return, thaw/setup Heracross Guts (bait status for 1.5x Atk) vs weakened remnants, clean sweep with boosted physicals if needed. Threats: Opp Gyarados DD post-burn (still dangerous, but Rock Slide/Megahorn chunks); avoid overexposing Gengar to Water/Thunder. Damage calcs: Kecleon Band Return vs Kyogre ~100%+ neutral (overkill at low HP); vs Mantine ~70-90% neutral; vs opp Gyarados ~50-60% neutral. Heracross Megahorn vs opp Gyarados ~70-90% neutral; Rock Slide ~100-130% 4x.\n\nKO'd opponent's Kyogre with Return—opponent now at 2 Pokémon: Mantine ~38% (defensive Water/Flying pivot, Water Absorb/Swift Swim likely; Return ~70-90% neutral chunk, OHKO probable at low HP; weak to potential Ice Punch from Gengar if switched). Gengar ~41% (special statuser with Levitate; immune to Return, so predict switch and pivot to Heracross Megahorn ~70-90% or Gengar Thunderbolt ~50-70%). Heracross ~63% frozen (physical sweeper; thaws soon, Guts Megahorn revenge on opponent's Gengar/Heracross ~70-90%, Rock Slide on Mantine 2x). All opponent team revealed and weakened; no hidden threats. My team: Kecleon 100% locked into Return (strong vs neutrals like Mantine/Heracross, Trick alternative unused for now but potential later if needed). Gengar 41% (WoW on opponent's Heracross to cripple, Thunderbolt on Mantine/Kyogre remnants ~50-70% in fading rain). Heracross 63% frozen (SD/Guts setup vs weakened foes post-thaw). Gyarados fainted. Rain ends after this upkeep—no more Drizzle boost. Win con: Secure KO, predict switch-in (likely Mantine for pivot or Gengar for status); if Mantine, stay in for Return OHKO; if Gengar, switch to Heracross Megahorn revenge; if Heracross, Return chunks then follow-up. Post-elimination, thaw/setup Heracross Guts (bait status for 1.5x Atk) to sweep remnants, use Gengar WoW + chip for cleanup. Kecleon can Trick Band onto a wall if opp stalls. Damage calcs: Return vs Mantine ~70-90% (OHKO at 38%); vs opp Heracross ~50-60% neutral; vs opp Gengar 0 (immune). Heracross Megahorn vs opp Gengar ~70-90% super effective. Preserve Gengar for status utility, avoid Ground weaknesses.\n\nCurrent matchup: My Kecleon vs. Opp Gyarados (53%, Intimidate DD physical sweeper likely Waterfall/EQ/Dragon Dance/Bounce; Leftovers). Post-Return: Expect Kecleon faint, Gyarados ~6%—revenge priority with Gengar Thunderbolt (super effective, ~OHKO even out of rain) or Heracross Megahorn (neutral ~70-90% from low HP, setup SD if safe post-thaw). Opponent team status: Gyarados ~6% post-turn, Kyogre 4% burned (Drizzle special sweeper, Specs?/Leftovers; OHKO any neutral hit, avoid re-summoning in rain reset), Swampert ~30% (mixed set Hydro Pump/EQ/Ice Beam; WoW to cripple, Megahorn ~70-90%), Mantine full (defensive pivot Water Absorb/Swift Swim/Leftovers; Thunderbolt ~70-90% neutral, Rock Slide 2x OHKO if Heracross). Opp Gengar ~41% (Levitate statuser Thunderbolt/WoW; immune to EQ, but frail—Megahorn super ~70-90%). Opp Heracross frozen 63% (Guts physical; thaw soon, WoW to prevent setup). My remaining: Gengar 41% (prioritize WoW on physical switches like Swampert/Gyarados rematch, Tbolt Waters/Flyings ~OHKO low threats; preserve vs Psychics), Heracross 63% frz (thaw 20% next active turn; bait status for Guts +1.5x, Megahorn revenge on Waters/Ghosts, Rock Slide on Flyings 2-4x, SD if safe vs weakened). Rain ends post-this turn (no Drizzle active). Long-term win con: Trade secures momentum, then eliminate low-HP threats (Kyogre/Swampert/Gyarados) with revenge killers; status remaining physicals (opp Heracross/Swampert) with Gengar WoW; thaw/setup Heracross Guts/SD to sweep Mantine/opp Gengar; bait switches with Intimidate if needed (though Gyarados fainted). Threats: Mantine pivot absorbing Electric/Water (counter with Rock Slide/Megahorn); opp Gengar status on Heracross (but frozen already); potential DD on low Gyarados if predicted switch (mitigate by fast revenge). Damage calcs: Return ~47% confirmed at -1; Gengar Tbolt vs low Gyarados ~100%+ super; Heracross Megahorn vs low Gyarados/Kyogre ~80-100%; vs Mantine ~60-80% neutral; Rock Slide vs Mantine ~70-90% 2x. If opp DD this turn instead, free chip + their +1 Spe/Atk at 6%—still cleanable before sweeping.\n\nKO'd Mantine with Return—opponent now at 3 Pokémon: Kecleon 100% -1 Atk (Color Change utility, likely Choice-locked if used before, moves Return/Shadow Ball/Focus Punch/Trick; neutral to Return ~50-60% chunk, then follow with Heracross Megahorn ~50-70% or Gengar Ice Punch coverage). Gengar ~41% (Levitate statuser, WoW/Thunderbolt; immune to normal/Ground—switch to Heracross Megahorn super ~70-90% on predicted switch). Heracross frozen ~63% (Guts physical, thaws ~20% next active turn; Megahorn revenge on Ghosts/Poisons/Waters ~70-90%, Rock Slide on Flyings 2-4x like potential rematch threats). Swampert low % (mixed set, crippled if WoW reapplied, Megahorn ~70-90%). All opponent team revealed/weakened; my Gyarados fnt but other 3 healthy-ish (Kecleon post-hit, Gengar 41%, Heracross 63% frz). Rain ends this upkeep—no more boosts/resets unless Kyogre back (but low/burned). Win con: Pressure Kecleon with Return chunk, revenge switch-ins with Heracross (bait status for Guts 1.5x + SD setup) or Gengar WoW/Thunderbolt (~50-70% on Waters/Flyings), clean sweep remnants with boosted physicals; use Kecleon Trick if unlocked later for item disruption on walls. Threats: Opp Kecleon Focus Punch (protect bait if predicted, but locked Return auto-hits); frozen Heracross thaw delay—preserve until safe; avoid Gengar exposure to strong neutrals. Damage calcs: Return vs opp Kecleon ~50-60% neutral; Heracross Megahorn vs opp Gengar ~70-90% super, vs Kecleon ~60-80% neutral; Gengar Thunderbolt vs Swampert/Mantine remnants ~60-80% if any.\n\nOpponent's Swampert: Mixed set (Hydro Pump special Water, Ice Beam coverage; likely Earthquake physical Ground). At 32% pre-turn, Return should KO even resisted—confirm damage post-turn. Team now: Swampert likely FNT, Gengar ~41% (Levitate statuser with WoW/Thunderbolt/Ice Punch/Taunt; frail, super weak to Heracross Megahorn ~70-90%, immune to Normal/Ground—switch predict and revenge). Heracross ~63% frozen (Guts physical with Megahorn/Rock Slide/Focus Punch/SD; thaws ~20% next active turn, WoW with Gengar to cripple setup ~halve Atk). All revealed, both weakened/statused. My team: Kecleon ~93% post-hit/tox (locked Return, bulky physical puncher; Trick unused for potential disruption on opp Gengar if it walls). Gengar 41% healthy (prioritize WoW on opp Heracross switch to prevent Guts/SD, Thunderbolt on any Water remnants if needed, Ice Punch coverage vs Grounds/Dragons; preserve for status vs physical threats). Heracross ~63% frozen (thaw imminent; bait status for Guts 1.5x + SD setup vs weakened Ghosts/Normals, Megahorn revenge on Gengar/Heracross ~70-90% super/neutral, Rock Slide if Flyings return). Gyarados/Mantine FNT. Rain ends post-this upkeep—no boosts/resets. Win con: KO Swampert secures momentum (opponent at 2), predict switch to Gengar (immune to Return—pivot Heracross Megahorn KO) or Heracross (Return chunks ~50-60% neutral, follow Gengar WoW + Heracross revenge); status opp Heracross with Gengar WoW early to neuter, thaw/setup my Heracross Guts/SD for clean sweep on frail remnants (Megahorn OHKOs Gengar post-WoW). Use Kecleon post-unlock for Trick on any stall attempts. Threats: Opp Gengar Taunt preventing WoW/setup, or Ice Punch on my Heracross switch (neutral, survivable); frozen thaw delay on both Heracrosses—act fast. Damage calcs: Return vs Swampert ~40-60% resisted but enough at 32%; Heracross Megahorn vs opp Gengar ~70-100% super; Gengar WoW on opp Heracross reliable status.\n\nKO'd opponent's Swampert with Return, bringing them to 3 remaining: Gengar ~41% (frail Levitate statuser; revenge with Heracross Megahorn ~70-90% super effective), Heracross ~63% frozen (Guts physical sweeper thawing soon; WoW with Gengar to cripple Atk/setup, then Megahorn neutral ~60-80%), Kecleon ~29% toxic Ground-type (Color Change utility Choice Band; chunked further if Return follows, Trick potential but low threat). All opponent Pokémon statused/weakened; no major sweepers left post-Gyarados FNT. My team post-KO: Kecleon ~20-25% after Toxic upkeep (3/16 damage, locked Return still; preserve for potential Trick unlock later or sac for momentum), Gengar 41% (key for WoW on opp Heracross to prevent Guts/SD, Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage vs Waters/Grounds/Dragons; avoid exposure to Focus Punch), Heracross 63% frozen (thaw 20% on next active turn; bait status for Guts 1.5x + SD setup vs frail remnants, Megahorn OHKOs Gengar, chunks Kecleon/Heracross). Rain fully ends post-upkeep—no Drizzle reset possible (Kyogre FNT low). Win con: Momentum from KO, predict switch and pivot to Heracross revenge (Megahorn on Gengar/Kecleon) or Gengar WoW on Heracross; thaw/setup my Heracross Guts/SD for double revenge potential vs opponent's physicals, clean sweep with boosted Atk/Spe while using Gengar chip/status for support. Threats: Opp Heracross thaw + Guts activation (mitigate with preemptive WoW); Gengar Taunt preventing my setup/status; low Kecleon Focus Punch if unprotected (but Return auto-hits). Damage calcs: Heracross Megahorn vs opp Gengar ~70-100% super, vs Kecleon/Heracross ~60-90% neutral; Gengar WoW reliable on switches, Ice Punch vs Kecleon Ground ~50-70% super. Preserve Heracross thaw timing for optimal setup window.\n\nSwampert KO'd next turn via Gengar Thunderbolt; opponent reduced to Gengar ~41% (frail Levitate statuser, OHKO with Heracross Megahorn super effective ~70-100%) and Heracross ~63% frozen (Guts physical sweeper, thaw ~20% chance/turn; preemptive WoW with Gengar to halve Atk and prevent SD/Guts setup, then neutral Megahorn ~60-90% or Rock Slide if needed). My Heracross ~63% frozen (thaw imminent post-switch; bait status for Guts 1.5x activation + SD setup vs remnants for overkill sweep, Megahorn super on opp Gengar ~70-100%). Gengar post-Tbolt ~30-35% (low risk from predicted Ice Beam; preserve for WoW on opp Heracross switch-in to cripple, Ice Punch/Trunt coverage if stalls). Kecleon FNT post-switch (sac for momentum, Trick unused but Band on opp wall irrelevant now). Rain ends this upkeep—no further boosts/resets. All threats revealed/weakened; win con: Secure Swampert KO, pivot Gengar to WoW opp Heracross on predicted switch (prevents boost), thaw/setup my Heracross Guts/SD for double revenge on frail Ghosts/physicals, cleanup with chip/status. No major risks: Opp Gengar Taunt preventable by prediction/speed, frozen delays mitigated by Gengar utility. Damage calcs: Gengar Tbolt vs Swampert ~100%+ super at 23%; Heracross Megahorn vs opp Gengar ~70-100% super, vs opp Heracross ~60-80% neutral; Gengar Ice Punch vs opp Heracross ~40-60% neutral if needed.\n\nKO'd Swampert with Thunderbolt, opponent now at 2 Pokémon: Gengar ~41% (frail Levitate statuser with Will-O-Wisp/Thunderbolt/Taunt/Ice Punch; revenge kill with my Heracross Megahorn super effective ~70-100%, immune to Normal/Ground—predict switch and pivot). Heracross ~63% frozen (Guts physical sweeper with Megahorn/Rock Slide/Focus Punch/Swords Dance; thaw ~20% chance/turn, but preemptive Will-O-Wisp with Gengar to halve Atk and prevent Guts/SD setup, then neutral Megahorn ~60-90% or Ice Punch coverage ~40-60%). All opponent threats revealed/weakened/statused; my Heracross ~63% frozen (thaw imminent on next active turn; bait status for Guts 1.5x + SD setup vs frail remnants, Megahorn OHKOs opp Gengar, chunks Heracross). Gengar post-KO ~35-40% (low from potential Hydro Pump/Ice Beam, but preserve for Will-O-Wisp on opp Heracross switch-in to cripple, then pivot to Heracross revenge). Kecleon ~11% toxic (locked into Return? Preserve as last resort or sac if needed, Trick unused for disruption). Rain ends post-this upkeep—no further boosts. Win con: Secure KO, pivot Gengar to Will-O-Wisp opp Heracross on predicted switch (prevents boost/setup), thaw/setup my Heracross Guts/SD for double revenge on frail Ghost/physical (Megahorn OHKOs Gengar, neutral on Heracross), cleanup remnants with boosted Atk/Spe while using Gengar chip/status support. Threats: Opp Gengar Taunt preventing my Will-O-Wisp/setup (mitigate by speed prediction), frozen thaw delay on my Heracross (use Gengar utility first); Ice Punch from opp Gengar on my Heracross switch (neutral, survivable at 63%). Damage calcs: Thunderbolt vs Swampert ~100%+ super at 29%; my Heracross Megahorn vs opp Gengar ~70-100% super, vs opp Heracross ~60-80% neutral; Gengar Will-O-Wisp reliable status on switches, Ice Punch vs opp Heracross ~40-60% neutral if needed for chip.\n\nKO'd Swampert with Thunderbolt, opponent now at ~2-3 weakened Pokémon: their Gengar ~54% (frail Levitate statuser, revenge with thawed Heracross Megahorn super effective ~70-100%), Kecleon ~11% toxic (Color Change low threat, easy OHKO with any neutral hit post-type change), possible Heracross (if they have one, WoW to prevent Guts/SD then neutral Megahorn ~60-80%). My team post-KO: Gengar ~20-40% (survivable from predicted Hydro Pump/Ice Beam, preserve for WoW on physical switches like potential Heracross/Heracross rematch, Tbolt cleanup on Waters if any remnants), Heracross 63% frozen (thaw ~20% chance next active turn; bait status for Guts 1.5x + SD setup vs frail Ghosts/Normals post-thaw, Megahorn OHKOs Gengar ~70-100% super, chunks Kecleon/Heracross neutral ~60-90%), Kecleon ~11% toxic Choice Band locked Return (low HP sac potential or Trick if unlocked for disruption on stalls). Rain ends post-this upkeep (no Drizzle active since Kyogre FNT). All opponent threats revealed/weakened/statused from log (Gyarados/Kyogre/Mantine/Swampert FNT); win con: Secure KO for momentum, predict switch (Gengar immune to normals but frail—pivot Heracross Megahorn if thawed, or WoW if physical), thaw/setup my Heracross Guts/SD for clean sweep on remnants (Megahorn prioritizes Ghosts, Rock Slide if Flyings return), use Gengar chip/status support while avoiding Taunt exposure. Threats: Their Gengar Taunt preventing WoW/setup (predict/speed to avoid), Ice Punch on my Heracross switch (neutral, survivable); frozen thaw delay (use Gengar first). Damage calcs: Thunderbolt vs Swampert ~100%+ super at 35% (rain boost); post-KO, Heracross Megahorn vs their Gengar ~70-100% super, vs Kecleon ~60-80% neutral; Gengar WoW reliable on switches, Ice Punch vs potential physicals ~40-60% neutral chip.\n\nOpponent down to final Pokémon: Swampert at 35% Torrent mixed set (Hydro Pump special Water boosted, Earthquake physical Ground coverage, Ice Beam; protect utility). Likely attacks on switch-in, but Heracross tanks neutral special or survives super physical given bulk/HP. Heracross frozen thaw 20% next turn— if thaws, Megahorn OHKO neutral (Atk 383 overkills low HP); if not, follow turn tanks and thaws for finish. Kecleon 11% TOX sacrificed if needed but preserved as backup—low threat now. All other opponent mons FNT (Gyarados/Kyogre/Mantine/Swampert was last). My win con: Switch Heracross, survive hit, thaw/KO Swampert next turn for victory. No remaining threats; Guts irrelevant without status, but SD possible post-KO if extra turns. Damage preds: Swampert Hydro Pump ~30-50% neutral special to Heracross (survivable at 63%); EQ ~40-60% super physical (still survives). Heracross Megahorn ~100%+ neutral on Swampert."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Heracross is frozen and cannot move this turn, providing a free hit. Swampert is at 42% HP with a special attacking moveset. Hydro Pump is the strongest option: Water-type STAB, neutral on Bug/Fighting, boosted by ongoing rain. This should deal significant damage, likely 70-100% or more to Heracross at 69% HP given Swampert's SpA and rain boost, potentially KOing it outright. Earthquake and Ice Beam are neutral but weaker options without STAB or boost. Protect is unnecessary since the opponent can't attack. Switching to Kecleon (11% toxic) is risky, as it would faint immediately if Heracross thaws next turn and uses a strong attack like Megahorn (super effective on Swampert). If Hydro Pump KOs, opponent sends their last Pokémon, Kecleon at 11% toxic, which dies to any neutral hit next turn. Even if it survives, Swampert can Protect or attack again, but KO is predicted for momentum and victory.", "action": "hydropump", "scratchpad": "Current state (turn 19): My Swampert active at 42% (Torrent not active yet, special mixed set: Hydro Pump rain-boosted STAB, Ice Beam coverage, Earthquake physical, Protect stall).

Win con: Hydro Pump free hit on frozen Heracross—predicted ~80-100% damage for KO (rain STAB neutral special vs bulky physical Def). If survives, next turn: Heracross thaws and likely KOs Swampert with Megahorn (2x super, high Atk 383); switch to Kecleon or Protect to stall, then revenge low Heracross/Kecleon easily. But KO secures immediate momentum—follow with Hydro Pump/Earthquake on incoming Kecleon for victory. No major threats left; preserve Swampert if possible for clean win.

turn):\nOpponent: Deoxys-A (Pressure, unknown item likely CB, Atk-focused, possible moves: Extreme Speed, Knock Off, Brick Break/Superpower; frail to special, weak to Ghost/Bug/Dark, neutral to Electric). Team: Jirachi (setup wall, preserve), Mewtwo (star special sweeper, Thunder OHKOs Deoxys-A, Ice Beam for Grounds/Dragons, Calm Mind late-game), Absol (special Dark coverage, Tbolt/Ice Beam for Waters/Flyers, lower priority), Magmar (Fire special, Cross Chop physical option, Thunder Punch coverage). Strategy: Offensive team, aim to setup with Jirachi/Mewtwo/Absol Calm Mind; sac Absol/Magmar if needed; predict switches post-Deoxys-A (likely Wobbuffet, Snorlax, Kyogre, Groudon common in Gen 3 Ubers). Track opponent item/moves after this turn. Damage notes: Mewtwo Thunder vs Deoxys-A ~275-324 (90%+); Jirachi HP Dark vs Deoxys-A ~184-217 (60-71%). Long-term: Control speed with Mewtwo, setup sweeps.\n\nMewtwo confirmed fainted after likely trading KO with Deoxys-A (Thunder vs. probable physical revenge kill). Opponent: Deoxys-A (Pressure, likely CB physical set: Extreme Speed/Knock Off/Brick Break/Superpower; frail, watch for lock-in from move that KO'd Mewtwo). Revealed move: Shadow Ball (special Ghost, unusual for Atk form). Team inference: Expect bulky switches like Wobbuffet/Snorlax/Kyogre/Groudon post-Deoxys-A. My team: Jirachi (setup wall, preserve for Calm Mind sweeps; resists Ghost/Psychic); Absol (special coverage for Waters/Flyers/Dragons with Tbolt/Ice Beam, CM setup, lower priority revenge); Magmar (Fire special attacker, Cross Chop for steels/rocks, sac if needed). Damage preds: Jirachi tanks Deoxys-A physical ~40-60% (bulk advantage); Psychic from Jirachi ~70-90% to Deoxys-A. Strategy: Setup on predicted switches after Deoxys-A; use Jirachi to absorb hits and boost SpA; pivot to Absol/Magmar for coverage. Track Deoxys-A's move this turn for set confirmation and lock-in. Long-term: Aim for late-game sweeps with boosted Jirachi/Absol; control with speed ties if any.\n\nOpponent Deoxys-A: Confirmed Pressure; used Shadow Ball (special Ghost, suggests possible mixed or special-leaning set with coverage; likely still physical primary: Extreme Speed/Knock Off/Brick Break/Superpower). Frail, ~359+ Spe, full HP. Tanks Jirachi physical ~40-60%, Psychic from Jirachi ~OHKO (super effective, high SpA delta). Team inference: Post-Deoxys, likely bulky switch-ins (Wobbuffet for trapping, Snorlax wall, Kyogre/Groudon weather). My team: Jirachi (preserve for CM setups, walls special/physical decently, resists Ghost/Psychic/Fighting); Mewtwo FNT (was special sweeper, Thunder/Ice Beam coverage lost); Absol (CM special Dark revenge, Tbolt/Ice Beam for Waters/Flyers/Dragons/Grasses, Speed 264 for ties); Magmar (Fire special, Cross Chop for Rocks/Steels, TPunch Electric coverage, Speed 270, sac option). Strategy: KO Deoxys-A with Psychic, then CM on predicted switch; pivot Absol for coverage if needed; aim late-game CM sweeps with Jirachi/Absol. Track Deoxys-A's move this turn for full set (e.g., if Superpower, lowers own stats; if CB-locked). Damage notes: Update post-turn. Long-term: Momentum after Deoxys KO, control with Jirachi bulk/speed control, sac Magmar if vs Ground/Steel threats.\n\nDeoxys-A confirmed: Pressure ability, used Shadow Ball twice (special Ghost, suggests special or mixed set with coverage; possible other moves: Psycho Boost, Thunderbolt, or physical like Superpower/Brick Break, but frail overall). KO'd with Psychic this turn. Spe tie possible (both ~328), but Jirachi bulk ensures survival. Opponent team inference: After Deoxys-A, expect switch to bulky trapper (Wobbuffet) or wall (Snorlax, Blissey), weather setter (Kyogre/Groudon), or another fast threat. My team: Jirachi (active, ~61% HP post-Leftover/turn, preserve for Calm Mind setups; walls special well, resists Ghost/Psychic/Fighting/Steel); Mewtwo FNT (special sweeper lost, had Thunder/Ice Beam/Self-Destruct/Calm Mind); Absol (full HP, special Dark CM revenge killer, Tbolt for Waters, Ice Beam for Grounds/Dragons/Grasses/Flyers, Spe 264 for revenge); Magmar (full HP, special Fire attacker, Cross Chop physical for Rocks/Steels, Thunder Punch Electric coverage, Spe 270, potential sac). Strategy: After Deoxys KO, CM on bulky switch prediction (Jirachi resists common attacks from Snorlax/Kyogre); if Wobbuffet switches, Psychic to chip/trap. Pivot Absol for coverage vs Waters/Dragons; use Magmar vs Steels/Grasses if needed. Long-term: Late-game CM sweeps with Jirachi/Absol; maintain momentum by punishing switches; watch for opponent items/abilities on next mon. Damage updates: Jirachi Psychic OHKO confirmed on Deoxys-A; track opponent switch and first move for set intel."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Failed to parse response", "action": null}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

Cure, item unknown - likely Leftovers/Lum). Possible moves: Recover, Leech Seed, Toxic, Psychic, Calm Mind. Team unknown beyond Celebi. My team: Sun core with Groudon (Drought), Shiftry (Chlorophyll Solar Beam), Charizard (Belly Drum sweeper). Deoxys for scouting/taunt/status. Goal: Set sun early with Groudon after scouting. Watch for Celebi switches to waters/grounds. Damage predictions: Deoxys frail but fast; preserve HP with Recover if needed. Long-term: Use sun to boost Fire moves and enable Shiftry/Charizard sweeps.\n\nOpponent: Celebi (Natural Cure, item unknown - likely Leftovers/Lum/Life Orb). Moves: Hidden Power (super effective on Psychic, likely Bug/Ghost/Dark for coverage; special attack). Taunted (prevents status moves; duration ~2-5 turns from turn 1, so active turn 2-3+). No other team revealed. My team: Deoxys-Speed (scout/taunt/pressure, frail but fast; at 69% post-turn 1). Shiftry (Chlorophyll sun abuser, Solar Beam/Explosion utility). Groudon (Drought setter, SD sweeper with EQ/HP/Fire). Charizard (Belly Drum + Salac physical sweeper, EQ for grounds). Strategy: Use Deoxys to neuter Celebi's utility with Taunt/Toxic, chip it down. If Celebi switches (e.g., to Water/Ground like Kyogre/Swampert), pivot to Groudon for sun and threaten. Preserve Deoxys HP with Recover if below 50%. Sun core win con: Drought boosts Fire moves (+50%), enables instant Solar Beam, boosts Charizard. Threats: Watch for priority, status spreaders, or steels resisting sun team. Damage calcs: Deoxys vs Celebi Toxic - immediate poison setup; expect 12.5% damage this upkeep if it stays.\n\nSun successfully set with Groudon entry (Drought). Deoxys preserved at 39% HP for later use (can Recover when safe). Celebi: 94% HP, Toxic (ticks to ~81% end of turn 3), Natural Cure - likely to switch out to cure status, watch for common partners like waters (Kyogre/Swampert) or steels. If Celebi stays, OHKO with EQ next turn. Opponent team still unknown; anticipate anti-sun threats like waters or Ttar. Damage calcs: Groudon vs Celebi HP Bug ~20-30%; Groudon EQ ~OHKO (2x SE, 300 effective power). Post-switch strategy: If Celebi switches to Water/Ground, threaten with Overheat/HP Fire under sun (+50% boost). If steels, pivot back to Deoxys Knock Off or Shiftry. Long-term: After handling Celebi, bring Shiftry for Chlorophyll sweep (double speed in sun, Solar Beam OHKOs many). Position Charizard for late-game Belly Drum + Salac activation.\n\nUpdated: Sun active (3 turns). Celebi: 88%, TOX (Natural Cure likely prompts switch this turn to cure; possible switches: Kyogre (Drizzle counters sun, weak to Overheat but resists EQ), Swampert (Ground/Water, absorbs EQ but weak to Overheat/HP? Wait, Fire resisted on Water), Metagross (Steel/Psychic, resists sun Fires but weak to HP Dark/EQ). Revealed moves: Celebi HP (special, ~16% on Groudon; likely Bug/Rock/Fire? But SE on Deoxys Psychic, so Bug/Ghost/Dark; vs Ground neutral/resisted). Strategy: SD this turn for +2 Atk safely. If switches to Water, follow with Overheat (sun-boosted, ~80-100% on standard Kyogre/Swampert despite resistance). If Ground/Rock, EQ OHKO. If Steel, pivot to Deoxys Knock Off or Shiftry Explosion if needed. Post-Celebi: Bring Shiftry for Chlorophyll (double speed in sun, Solar Beam sweeps frail Ubers). Position Charizard for Belly Drum once weakened. Threats: Drizzle from Kyogre (ends sun), priority (none seen), or Baton Pass chains. Damage calcs needed: +2 Groudon EQ vs Swampert ~90-110% (SE); Overheat vs Kyogre ~70-90% sun-boosted. Preserve Deoxys/Shiftry HP; win con sun sweep with boosted Groudon -> Shiftry/Charizard.\n\nCorrection: EQ is resisted by Celebi's Grass typing (neutral on Psychic, 0.5x overall), so ~30-40% on full HP at +2 (leaves 76% at ~40-50% after hit + Toxic tick). Still pressures, as follow-up EQ next turn KOs. Sun: 4 turns remaining (upkeep after this: 3). Likely switch-in to cure Toxic: prioritize anti-Water/Ground (EQ neutral chunks Kyogre ~60%, Swampert ~50%; Overheat alt for Fire-weak but low SpA). If Metagross/Steel, EQ SE ~90-110%. Opponent team: Celebi (Natural Cure/Leftovers, moves: HP [likely Bug, SE on Psychic/Deoxys, neutral on Ground], Psychic [~25% on Groudon]); expect Kyogre (Drizzle threat, ends sun - preserve Overheat for it), Swampert, Snorlax, or Lati@s. No priority/steels revealed yet. My positioning: Groudon as physical wallbreaker/setup under sun; after Celebi down, switch to Shiftry (Chlorophyll doubles Speed to ~400+, Solar Beam OHKOs frail Ubers like Lati/Kyogre in sun). Save Deoxys (39%, Recover avail) for scouting/status on switches. Charizard late-game Belly Drum + Salac (+Speed at low HP) physical sweeper with EQ/DE for coverage. Win con: Maintain sun, eliminate Celebi, sweep with Shiftry/Charizard. Threats: Drizzle rain (ends sun, weakens Fire), bulky waters absorbing Groudon, potential Baton Pass (one allowed). Damage tracking: Groudon tanks 1-2 Psychics; EQ vs common: +2 Groudon EQ vs 100% Kyogre ~55-65% (neutral); vs Swampert ~45-55%; vs Metagross ~90-105% (SE). Preserve team HP, bait switches.\n\nCelebi HP tracking: 17% TOX entering turn 6; if stays, post-Psychic: upkeep Leftovers to ~23%, then 5/16 tox tick ~31% faints it. Natural Cure switch highly likely to cure (common: Kyogre Drizzle ends sun but Ground immune to Thunder, Surf weakened in sun; Swampert EQ-immune/bulky Water/Ground; Metagross Steel/Psychic weak to EQ; Snorlax bulky neutral; Latias Dragon/Psychic resists EQ). Groudon +2 -> +4 SD safe: chunks/OHKOs most on +4 EQ (e.g., +4 EQ vs Kyogre ~90-110% neutral sun-irrelevant; vs Swampert ~70-90% but immune wait no, Swampert Ground immune to EQ; adjust: use Overheat/HP Dark if immune). If Swampert in, survives likely (~30-40% from Swampert Waterfall/EQ), then switch to Charizard (EQ coverage, Salac potential). Sun remaining: ~4 turns (set turn 3, up to 8 total). Opponent team: Celebi (Natural Cure/Leftovers, moves: Hidden Power [Bug? SE Psychic, neutral Ground ~16-20%], Psychic ~30% on Groudon); expect Kyogre (counter sun), Swampert, Metagross, Snorlax/Latias. No priority/status/Baton Pass seen. My positioning: +4 Groudon breaks walls, then Shiftry Chlorophyll (speed ~406 in sun, Solar Beam OHKOs frail like Latias/Kyogre), Deoxys (39% Recover) for late status/scout, Charizard Belly Drum + Salac for cleanup. Threats: Drizzle rain ends sun (weakens Fires/Waters), bulky Waters stalling Groudon, potential Steels resisting Fires. Damage calcs: Baseline +2 EQ vs Celebi resisted ~40%; +4 EQ vs Metagross 2x ~120-140%; vs Snorlax neutral ~80-100%. Post-Celebi KO, maintain sun, sweep with sun abusers. Watch for Deoxys re-entry if steels.\n\nUpdated opponent: Celebi KO'd (Natural Cure/Leftovers; moves: Hidden Power [Bug, ~20% on Groudon], Psychic [~30%, SpD drop]); Salamence (Intimidate/M, full HP, unknown item; likely DD Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide/HP Fire physical set, Spe ~290-328 outspeeds most team except Deoxys). Opponent team: 3 remaining (4 total, expect Kyogre Drizzle/Swampert/Metagross/Snorlax/Latias to counter sun). Damage tracking: Groudon +2 net Atk (after Intimidate, from +3 SD -1), EQ OHKOs Salamence (SE 2x, ~120-140%); tanks 1-2 hits normally but low HP now. Deoxys 39%, switch to Taunt DD. Shiftry 100%, Chlorophyll (Spe 406 in sun) for Solar Beam (resisted on Mence, but HP likely Ice for 4x?); Explosion sac option. Charizard 100%, Belly Drum + Salac for late sweep (EQ covers Grounds, Double Edge neutral, Fire Blast sun-boosted). Sun: 6 turns left, critical for boosts (Fire +50%, Chlorophyll double Spe). Win con: Deoxys Taunts Mence, pivot to Groudon EQ KO, then Shiftry Chlorophyll sweep frail remnants, Charizard cleanup. Threats: Mence DD (Taunt counters), Drizzle ends sun (preserve Overheat/HP Fire on Groudon for Kyogre), bulky Waters immune/resist EQ (use Charizard EQ/Fire Blast), Steels resist Fires (Deoxys Knock Off/Deoxys pivot). Post-Mence: Bait switches, maintain sun, sweep with abusers. Preserve Groudon/Deoxys HP.\n\nScratchpad update: Active now Groudon low 17% +3 Atk (net after Intimidate), switching to Shiftry to revenge Salamence safely. Sun active turn 7 (ends post-upkeep; total 5 turns from Drought set turn 3). Deoxys at ~39% HP (log accurate, ignore data FNT error; Recover available for later Taunt/Toxic scouting). Groudon preserved for Drought re-summon or +3 EQ wallbreaking vs. weakened foes. Charizard 100% for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep (activate at low HP). Opponent: Salamence (Intimidate/M/100%, likely physical DD set: Dragon Claw/Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide/HP Fire; Speed ~300, outspeeds Groudon/Charizard but not Chlorophyll Shiftry). Revealed: Celebi KO (Natural Cure/Leftovers, moves: HP Bug ~20% neutral, Psychic ~30% + SpD drop). Remaining 2: Likely Kyogre (Drizzle rain counter, weak to Overheat/sun Fire), Swampert (bulky Water/Ground, EQ immune—use Shiftry Solar Beam or Charizard EQ/Fire Blast). Possible Metagross/Snorlax/Latias. No priority/Baton Pass seen. Win con: Shiftry Chlorophyll revenge KO on Salamence (outspeed, Solar Beam chip/HP Ice potential OHKO), maintain/extend sun with Shiftry Sunny Day if ends, sweep waters with Solar Beam OHKO in sun, preserve Groudon for anti-water Overheat, Charizard cleanup vs. steels/grounds. Damage est: Shiftry takes ~50% from Mence Dragon Claw (survives), then Solar Beam ~40% resisted on Mence; follow-up ~70-90% if +1 or HP Ice. Vs Kyogre/Swampert: Solar Beam 2x SE sun instant ~100-120%. Watch switches to bulky waters (pivot Groudon Overheat ~80% sun-boosted neutral/ resisted). If Mence DDs, still outspeed but pressure with status later via Deoxys.\n\nTurn 8: Shiftry active vs full Salamence (Intimidate/M, physical DD set likely: Dragon Claw/Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide/HP Fire; ~300 Spe, vulnerable to Ground but immune EQ via Flying). Sun permanent via Groudon (alive @17%, +3 Atk net), enables Chlorophyll (Shiftry Spe 406) and instant Solar Beam. Damage: Solar Beam ~50-70% on Mence (STAB Grass 0.5x resist); survives Dragon Claw ~60-80% (high HP 355, mod Def 156) for revenge next turn if needed. Team: Deoxys FNT (error in obs, actually ~39% from log, Recover avail for late Taunt); Groudon 17% +3 Atk (EQ OHKOs non-Flying/Grounds, Overheat sun-boost vs Waters ~80%); Charizard 100% Belly Drum + Salac sweeper (EQ coverage, Fire Blast sun SE). Opponent: Celebi KO; Salamence full; remaining 2 likely Kyogre (Drizzle threat, Solar Beam/Overheat OHKO), Swampert (Solar Beam OHKO, EQ immune—use Charizard). Possible Metagross (EQ SE, Solar Beam neutral), Snorlax/Latias (Solar Beam ~70-90%). Win con: Chunk Mence with Solar Beam, revenge if attacks, then sweep with Shiftry Chlorophyll Solar Beam on frail Waters/Dragons, pivot Groudon for bulky Grounds/Steels if possible, Charizard late cleanup. Threats: Mence DD/Outrage locks (outspeed counters), Drizzle ends sun (prioritize KO Kyogre first), bulky resists (position EQ/Explosion). Preserve sun abusers; if Mence switches (e.g., to Steel), Solar Beam neutral chunk. Next: If Mence low, stay for KO; if switches to Water, OHKO with Solar Beam."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Shiftry is active at full HP against Salamence at full HP under sun (Drought active, will last several more turns). Chlorophyll doubles Shiftry's Speed to ~406, outspeeding Salamence (~300 base). Solar Beam is instant in sun, STAB Grass move; resisted by Salamence's Flying type (0.5x), but Shiftry's high SpA (306) should chunk ~40-60% damage, pressuring a likely physical Dragon Dance set. Shiftry can tank a Dragon Claw (super effective but bulky HP/Def should leave it above 50%). If Salamence switches (e.g., to Water like Swampert/Kyogre), Solar Beam OHKOs SE. Avoid Explosion sac early with full team; Hidden Power unknown but Solar Beam optimal pressure. No need to switch: Groudon low HP (17%, +3 Atk but vulnerable), Charizard save for late sweep.
