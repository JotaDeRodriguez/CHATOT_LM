Staying in risks a KO from the opponent's full-HP Charizard, who outspeeds or ties without guaranteed KO (Fire Blast or Double Edge only deal ~50-60% damage). Earthquake is ineffective due to Flying immunity. Switching is necessary to preserve my late-game Belly Drum sweeper. Medicham is the optimal switch: its Fighting/Psychic typing and bulk (HP 262, Def/SpD 186) allow it to survive a Fire Blast (~82% damage, neutral) or Earthquake (~51% damage, super effective but Electric? Wait, no—Ground is neutral on Fighting/Psychic). Lanturn would be immune to EQ but my full-HP one isn't low; however, Medicham better positions for immediate threat removal with Choice Band Pure Power Rock Slide (super effective on opponent's Flying, massive damage output with doubled Attack and Band).

Assume standard Ubers set. Track any revealed moves/abilities. My strategy: Deoxys for speed control and support (Taunt/Toxic to cripple setup sweepers). Medicham as Choice Band Pure Power wallbreaker for revenge killing. Charizard Belly Drum sweeper late-game with Salac for speed boost. Lanturn as special tank with Volt Absorb/Water absorb potential threats. Win conditions: Disable opponent setups early, break walls with Medicham/Charizard, stall with Lanturn/Deoxys Recover. Watch for opponent's other team members; prioritize removing threats to my sweepers like potential Waters or Rocks.\n\nCurrent state: My Deoxys at full after Recover vs. Opp Charizard full. Opp team revealed: Deoxys-Speed (Pressure, Leftovers, likely support), Charizard (Blaze, unknown item/moves beyond possible Fire). Next: Taunt to block setup, or Toxic for chip damage. If Charizard sacs or switches, pivot to Medicham for Choice Band Brick Break/Rock Slide on threats. Track damage: My Fire Blast chipped Deoxys to 52% initially. Long-term: Use Deoxys to status/harass, then sweep with Medicham/Charizard.\n\nOpp Charizard vs Lanturn now; likely Fire Blast, but if EQ predicted unlikely. Lanturn Tbolt OHKOs. If opp switches out, pursue with status from Deoxys later. Deoxys preserved at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setup threats. Opp revealed: Deoxys-Speed support (Recover, Pressure, Leftovers), Charizard offensive (Blaze, likely Fire Blast, possible EQ/Belly Drum). Track damage: Lanturn can tank 2x Fire Blast (~44%), 1x EQ (~82%). Win con: Remove Charizard, then use Medicham to break, Deoxys status control.\n\nOpponent's Charizard: Special attacker confirmed (Fire Blast x2), low EQ likelihood. Tbolt should chunk to ~20-40% HP. Lanturn post-turn ~9% but alive; consider Rest if pressured later. Deoxys at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setups. Medicham preserved for wallbreaking. Watch for opponent revenge kill or switch to Ground/anti-Lanturn. Next: Finish Charizard if low, or pivot if switch.\n\nSwitched to own Charizard to counter potential EQ/Fire Blast safely. Opponent Charizard confirmed: Blaze, Salac Berry (consumed), Fire Blast user, likely EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace possible. Post-KO, assess opponent's switch-in: prioritize Taunt/Toxic with Deoxys on setups, or Medicham wallbreak. Lanturn preserved at ~26% for future tanking Volt Absorb threats.

Staying in risks Medicham fainting before acting. Among moves, Brick Break offers the highest damage (STAB neutral), potentially chunking Zapdos significantly due to Choice Band + Pure Power's immense Attack, but the risk of being KO'd first outweighs it. Switching to Lanturn is ideal: Volt Absorb heals from Thunderbolt (Zapdos's likely STAB), boosting Lanturn from 26% by ~25% HP (to ~51%), then burn damage (~6-12%) leaves it at a survivable ~40%. Lanturn then threatens big damage with Surf (2x SE on Zapdos) or Thunderbolt (neutral but high SpA).

Assume standard Ubers set. Track any revealed moves/abilities. My strategy: Deoxys for speed control and support (Taunt/Toxic to cripple setup sweepers). Medicham as Choice Band Pure Power wallbreaker for revenge killing. Charizard Belly Drum sweeper late-game with Salac for speed boost. Lanturn as special tank with Volt Absorb/Water absorb potential threats. Win conditions: Disable opponent setups early, break walls with Medicham/Charizard, stall with Lanturn/Deoxys Recover. Watch for opponent's other team members; prioritize removing threats to my sweepers like potential Waters or Rocks.\n\nCurrent state: My Deoxys at full after Recover vs. Opp Charizard full. Opp team revealed: Deoxys-Speed (Pressure, Leftovers, likely support), Charizard (Blaze, unknown item/moves beyond possible Fire). Next: Taunt to block setup, or Toxic for chip damage. If Charizard sacs or switches, pivot to Medicham for Choice Band Brick Break/Rock Slide on threats. Track damage: My Fire Blast chipped Deoxys to 52% initially. Long-term: Use Deoxys to status/harass, then sweep with Medicham/Charizard.\n\nOpp Charizard vs Lanturn now; likely Fire Blast, but if EQ predicted unlikely. Lanturn Tbolt OHKOs. If opp switches out, pursue with status from Deoxys later. Deoxys preserved at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setup threats. Opp revealed: Deoxys-Speed support (Recover, Pressure, Leftovers), Charizard offensive (Blaze, likely Fire Blast, possible EQ/Belly Drum). Track damage: Lanturn can tank 2x Fire Blast (~44%), 1x EQ (~82%). Win con: Remove Charizard, then use Medicham to break, Deoxys status control.\n\nOpponent's Charizard: Special attacker confirmed (Fire Blast x2), low EQ likelihood. Tbolt should chunk to ~20-40% HP. Lanturn post-turn ~9% but alive; consider Rest if pressured later. Deoxys at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setups. Medicham preserved for wallbreaking. Watch for opponent revenge kill or switch to Ground/anti-Lanturn. Next: Finish Charizard if low, or pivot if switch.\n\nSwitched to own Charizard to counter potential EQ/Fire Blast safely. Opponent Charizard confirmed: Blaze, Salac Berry (consumed), Fire Blast user, likely EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace possible. Post-KO, assess opponent's switch-in: prioritize Taunt/Toxic with Deoxys on setups, or Medicham wallbreak. Lanturn preserved at ~26% for future tanking Volt Absorb threats. Win con: Use Deoxys status control, Medicham breaks, own Charizard sweeps post-Drum if safe.\n\nHP correction: My Charizard ~2% (preserve for setup sweep); Medicham/Lanturn/Deoxys full HP. Opponent Charizard full HP, special Fire Blast user (Blaze, possible EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum); Deoxys-Speed (Pressure/Leftovers/Recover/Taunt? support); Lanturn (Volt Absorb/Leftovers/brn 26%/Thunderbolt/Surf). Fourth opp mon unknown—anticipate water/ground/steel threat. Post-switch, Medicham locks Rock Slide to remove flying/fire threats; if opp switches to ground-weak, pivot to Brick Break. Use Deoxys Taunt/Toxic on predicted setups (e.g., opp Drum). Lanturn rests if needed, absorbs electrics. Win path: Eliminate opp Charizard now, status Deoxys/Lanturn, then Medicham breaks walls, Charizard sweeps. Avoid double switches; predict opp sac if low.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item/moves; assume standard set (Tbolt, Drill Peck, HP Ice/Ground, Roost?); special attacker likely. Revealing more of opponent's team (remaining 2 unknown; watch for waters/grounds/steels as counters to my Charizard/Medicham). My Medicham preserved at 43% for future wallbreaking (prioritize Brick Break on normals/steels, Rock Slide on flyers/fires, Shadow Ball on psychics/ghosts; avoid locking into resisted moves). Lanturn post-switch: ~26% brn, use to absorb electrics and chip with Surf/Tbolt; consider Rest if HP drops further. Deoxys at 56%: keep for speed control, Taunt on setups (e.g., if opp Kyogre/Groudon), Toxic walls. Charizard at 100%, Salac uneaten?: save for Belly Drum sweep late-game after threats removed. Win path: Wall Zapdos with Lanturn, KO with Surf if chipped, then Medicham revenges, Deoxys statuses remainer, Charizard closes. Track if Zapdos switches out predictably."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Zapdos is an Electric/Flying type with Pressure ability and known to use Thunderbolt. Given its typing, it will likely attempt an Electric-type attack like Thunderbolt, but Lanturn's Volt Absorb ability will absorb it, healing Lanturn instead of taking damage. This is a favorable matchup for Lanturn. In response, Surf is super effective against Zapdos due to its Flying typing (Water is super effective on Flying, neutral on Electric). Thunderbolt would be resisted by Zapdos (Electric on Electric), making it less optimal. Rest or Sleep Talk are unnecessary as Lanturn can tank non-Electric moves and heal via Volt Absorb/Leftovers. Switching out risks losing momentum, as Medicham is weak to potential Flying moves (e.g., Drill Peck) from Zapdos, Deoxys might get chipped, and Charizard is weak to Rock/Stone Edge if Zapdos has coverage. Stay in to exploit the Volt Absorb advantage, heal up, and deal significant damage with Surf. Lanturn's burn halves its Special Attack, but Surf should still chunk Zapdos substantially (estimated 40-60% damage based on standard Gen 3 stats). Post-turn, Lanturn will gain Leftovers recovery minus burn damage, maintaining viability as a pivot/tank.", "action": "surf", "scratchpad": "Opponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item (assume standard Leftovers/Roost set), moves include Thunderbolt (Electric STAB), likely Drill Peck (Flying STAB super on Fighting/Psychic), possible HP Ice/Ground for coverage, Roost for recovery. Volt Absorb perfectly walls Electric moves—heal and counter with Surf (super effective, predicted ~50% damage even with burn). If Zapdos switches or uses non-Electric, reassess; predict Tbolt lock-in. Track damage calc: Lanturn Spa 276 halved to ~138 effective, Zapdos SpD ~200-250, Surf base 95, should 2HKO if no Roost. My Lanturn post-turn: +Volt Absorb heal (~25-30% from Tbolt) +6.25% Leftovers -12.5% burn, net positive to ~55-60%. Next: If Zapdos low, stay to finish; else switch Medicham for Rock Slide revenge (super on Zapdos). Deoxys Taunt/Toxic priority on any setup from Zapdos or switches (e.g., if Groudon/Kyogre hidden). Opp remaining mons: Deoxys 56%, Medicham 43%, unknown fourth (suspect ground/water counter). Win path: Wall/chip Zapdos with Lanturn, revenge with Medicham Rock Slide, status Deoxys/Medicham with Deoxys, sweep with Charizard Belly Drum."}, "outcome": "win", "is_valid_response": true}

Assume standard Ubers set. Track any revealed moves/abilities. My strategy: Deoxys for speed control and support (Taunt/Toxic to cripple setup sweepers). Medicham as Choice Band Pure Power wallbreaker for revenge killing. Charizard Belly Drum sweeper late-game with Salac for speed boost. Lanturn as special tank with Volt Absorb/Water absorb potential threats. Win conditions: Disable opponent setups early, break walls with Medicham/Charizard, stall with Lanturn/Deoxys Recover. Watch for opponent's other team members; prioritize removing threats to my sweepers like potential Waters or Rocks.\n\nCurrent state: My Deoxys at full after Recover vs. Opp Charizard full. Opp team revealed: Deoxys-Speed (Pressure, Leftovers, likely support), Charizard (Blaze, unknown item/moves beyond possible Fire). Next: Taunt to block setup, or Toxic for chip damage. If Charizard sacs or switches, pivot to Medicham for Choice Band Brick Break/Rock Slide on threats. Track damage: My Fire Blast chipped Deoxys to 52% initially. Long-term: Use Deoxys to status/harass, then sweep with Medicham/Charizard.\n\nOpp Charizard vs Lanturn now; likely Fire Blast, but if EQ predicted unlikely. Lanturn Tbolt OHKOs. If opp switches out, pursue with status from Deoxys later. Deoxys preserved at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setup threats. Opp revealed: Deoxys-Speed support (Recover, Pressure, Leftovers), Charizard offensive (Blaze, likely Fire Blast, possible EQ/Belly Drum). Track damage: Lanturn can tank 2x Fire Blast (~44%), 1x EQ (~82%). Win con: Remove Charizard, then use Medicham to break, Deoxys status control.\n\nOpponent's Charizard: Special attacker confirmed (Fire Blast x2), low EQ likelihood. Tbolt should chunk to ~20-40% HP. Lanturn post-turn ~9% but alive; consider Rest if pressured later. Deoxys at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setups. Medicham preserved for wallbreaking. Watch for opponent revenge kill or switch to Ground/anti-Lanturn. Next: Finish Charizard if low, or pivot if switch.\n\nSwitched to own Charizard to counter potential EQ/Fire Blast safely. Opponent Charizard confirmed: Blaze, Salac Berry (consumed), Fire Blast user, likely EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace possible. Post-KO, assess opponent's switch-in: prioritize Taunt/Toxic with Deoxys on setups, or Medicham wallbreak. Lanturn preserved at ~26% for future tanking Volt Absorb threats. Win con: Use Deoxys status control, Medicham breaks, own Charizard sweeps post-Drum if safe.\n\nHP correction: My Charizard ~2% (preserve for setup sweep); Medicham/Lanturn/Deoxys full HP. Opponent Charizard full HP, special Fire Blast user (Blaze, possible EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum); Deoxys-Speed (Pressure/Leftovers/Recover/Taunt? support); Lanturn (Volt Absorb/Leftovers/brn 26%/Thunderbolt/Surf). Fourth opp mon unknown—anticipate water/ground/steel threat. Post-switch, Medicham locks Rock Slide to remove flying/fire threats; if opp switches to ground-weak, pivot to Brick Break. Use Deoxys Taunt/Toxic on predicted setups (e.g., opp Drum). Lanturn rests if needed, absorbs electrics. Win path: Eliminate opp Charizard now, status Deoxys/Lanturn, then Medicham breaks walls, Charizard sweeps. Avoid double switches; predict opp sac if low.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item/moves; assume standard set (Tbolt, Drill Peck, HP Ice/Ground, Roost?); special attacker likely. Revealing more of opponent's team (remaining 2 unknown; watch for waters/grounds/steels as counters to my Charizard/Medicham). My Medicham preserved at 43% for future wallbreaking (prioritize Brick Break on normals/steels, Rock Slide on flyers/fires, Shadow Ball on psychics/ghosts; avoid locking into resisted moves). Lanturn post-switch: ~26% brn, use to absorb electrics and chip with Surf/Tbolt; consider Rest if HP drops further. Deoxys at 56%: keep for speed control, Taunt on setups (e.g., if opp Kyogre/Groudon), Toxic walls. Charizard at 100%, Salac uneaten?: save for Belly Drum sweep late-game after threats removed. Win path: Wall Zapdos with Lanturn, KO with Surf if chipped, then Medicham revenges, Deoxys statuses remainer, Charizard closes. Track if Zapdos switches out predictably.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item (assume standard Leftovers/Roost set), moves include Thunderbolt (Electric STAB), likely Drill Peck (Flying STAB super on Fighting/Psychic), possible HP Ice/Ground for coverage, Roost for recovery. Volt Absorb perfectly walls Electric moves—heal and counter with Surf (super effective, predicted ~50% damage even with burn). If Zapdos switches or uses non-Electric, reassess; predict Tbolt lock-in. Track damage calc: Lanturn Spa 276 halved to ~138 effective, Zapdos SpD ~200-250, Surf base 95, should 2HKO if no Roost. My Lanturn post-turn: +Volt Absorb heal (~25-30% from Tbolt) +6.25% Leftovers -12.5% burn, net positive to ~55-60%. Next: If Zapdos low, stay to finish; else switch Medicham for Rock Slide revenge (super on Zapdos). Deoxys Taunt/Toxic priority on any setup from Zapdos or switches (e.g., if Groudon/Kyogre hidden). Opp remaining mons: Deoxys 56%, Medicham 43%, unknown fourth (suspect ground/water counter). Win path: Wall/chip Zapdos with Lanturn, revenge with Medicham Rock Slide, status Deoxys/Medicham with Deoxys, sweep with Charizard Belly Drum."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Current matchup: My Lanturn (Water/Electric, Volt Absorb, Leftovers, 63% HP, BRN) vs. Opponent's Zapdos (Electric/Flying, Pressure, Leftovers, 61% HP, known move: Thunderbolt). Zapdos likely leads with Thunderbolt due to STAB and previous usage pattern, which Volt Absorb will fully heal Lanturn (estimated +25-30% HP from absorption). Surf is neutral damage but with Lanturn's high SpA (276), it should deal significant damage to Zapdos (base 95 power, estimated 40-50% or more based on stats, potentially low-rolling into KO range considering Zapdos at 61%). Burn halves physical Attack but not SpA, so Surf remains effective. Rest/Sleep Talk risky as it locks out counterplay if Zapdos switches or uses coverage. Thunderbolt on Zapdos is resisted (0.5x Electric on Electric). Switching Deoxys-Speed risky (Psychic weak to potential Dark coverage or just low bulk); Medicham weak to Flying (likely Drill Peck); Charizard resists Electric but vulnerable to predicted Flying moves and needs preservation for late-game Belly Drum sweep. Optimal: Stay in, absorb Tbolt for heal, retaliate with Surf to chunk or KO Zapdos, gaining momentum. Post-turn, Lanturn HP: +absorb (25%) + Leftovers (6%) - burn (12%) ≈ 82% net. If Zapdos survives, follow up next turn or switch to Medicham for Rock Slide revenge kill.", "action": "surf", "scratchpad": "Opp Zapdos confirmed special attacker (Tbolt STAB), likely set: Leftovers, possible Drill Peck/HP Ice/Roost/Twave. Surf calc: Lanturn SpA 276 vs Zapdos SpD ~200-250, base 95 Water neutral ≈35-45% damage at 61% HP (possible KO with variance). If survives, Medicham Rock Slide (super effective on Flying) for revenge. Preserve Deoxys 56% for Taunt/Toxic on opp setups (remaining unknown mon likely ground/water counter to Charizard). Opp team: Charizard FNT, Lanturn 63% BRN (Surf/Tbolt, walls electrics), Deoxys 56% (support Recover), Medicham 43% (physical?); suspect fourth as Snorlax/Metagross/Kyogre.

Assume standard Ubers set. Track any revealed moves/abilities. My strategy: Deoxys for speed control and support (Taunt/Toxic to cripple setup sweepers). Medicham as Choice Band Pure Power wallbreaker for revenge killing. Charizard Belly Drum sweeper late-game with Salac for speed boost. Lanturn as special tank with Volt Absorb/Water absorb potential threats. Win conditions: Disable opponent setups early, break walls with Medicham/Charizard, stall with Lanturn/Deoxys Recover. Watch for opponent's other team members; prioritize removing threats to my sweepers like potential Waters or Rocks.\n\nCurrent state: My Deoxys at full after Recover vs. Opp Charizard full. Opp team revealed: Deoxys-Speed (Pressure, Leftovers, likely support), Charizard (Blaze, unknown item/moves beyond possible Fire). Next: Taunt to block setup, or Toxic for chip damage. If Charizard sacs or switches, pivot to Medicham for Choice Band Brick Break/Rock Slide on threats. Track damage: My Fire Blast chipped Deoxys to 52% initially. Long-term: Use Deoxys to status/harass, then sweep with Medicham/Charizard.\n\nOpp Charizard vs Lanturn now; likely Fire Blast, but if EQ predicted unlikely. Lanturn Tbolt OHKOs. If opp switches out, pursue with status from Deoxys later. Deoxys preserved at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setup threats. Opp revealed: Deoxys-Speed support (Recover, Pressure, Leftovers), Charizard offensive (Blaze, likely Fire Blast, possible EQ/Belly Drum). Track damage: Lanturn can tank 2x Fire Blast (~44%), 1x EQ (~82%). Win con: Remove Charizard, then use Medicham to break, Deoxys status control.\n\nOpponent's Charizard: Special attacker confirmed (Fire Blast x2), low EQ likelihood. Tbolt should chunk to ~20-40% HP. Lanturn post-turn ~9% but alive; consider Rest if pressured later. Deoxys at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setups. Medicham preserved for wallbreaking. Watch for opponent revenge kill or switch to Ground/anti-Lanturn. Next: Finish Charizard if low, or pivot if switch.\n\nSwitched to own Charizard to counter potential EQ/Fire Blast safely. Opponent Charizard confirmed: Blaze, Salac Berry (consumed), Fire Blast user, likely EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace possible. Post-KO, assess opponent's switch-in: prioritize Taunt/Toxic with Deoxys on setups, or Medicham wallbreak. Lanturn preserved at ~26% for future tanking Volt Absorb threats. Win con: Use Deoxys status control, Medicham breaks, own Charizard sweeps post-Drum if safe.\n\nHP correction: My Charizard ~2% (preserve for setup sweep); Medicham/Lanturn/Deoxys full HP. Opponent Charizard full HP, special Fire Blast user (Blaze, possible EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum); Deoxys-Speed (Pressure/Leftovers/Recover/Taunt? support); Lanturn (Volt Absorb/Leftovers/brn 26%/Thunderbolt/Surf). Fourth opp mon unknown—anticipate water/ground/steel threat. Post-switch, Medicham locks Rock Slide to remove flying/fire threats; if opp switches to ground-weak, pivot to Brick Break. Use Deoxys Taunt/Toxic on predicted setups (e.g., opp Drum). Lanturn rests if needed, absorbs electrics. Win path: Eliminate opp Charizard now, status Deoxys/Lanturn, then Medicham breaks walls, Charizard sweeps. Avoid double switches; predict opp sac if low.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item/moves; assume standard set (Tbolt, Drill Peck, HP Ice/Ground, Roost?); special attacker likely. Revealing more of opponent's team (remaining 2 unknown; watch for waters/grounds/steels as counters to my Charizard/Medicham). My Medicham preserved at 43% for future wallbreaking (prioritize Brick Break on normals/steels, Rock Slide on flyers/fires, Shadow Ball on psychics/ghosts; avoid locking into resisted moves). Lanturn post-switch: ~26% brn, use to absorb electrics and chip with Surf/Tbolt; consider Rest if HP drops further. Deoxys at 56%: keep for speed control, Taunt on setups (e.g., if opp Kyogre/Groudon), Toxic walls. Charizard at 100%, Salac uneaten?: save for Belly Drum sweep late-game after threats removed. Win path: Wall Zapdos with Lanturn, KO with Surf if chipped, then Medicham revenges, Deoxys statuses remainer, Charizard closes. Track if Zapdos switches out predictably.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item (assume standard Leftovers/Roost set), moves include Thunderbolt (Electric STAB), likely Drill Peck (Flying STAB super on Fighting/Psychic), possible HP Ice/Ground for coverage, Roost for recovery. Volt Absorb perfectly walls Electric moves—heal and counter with Surf (super effective, predicted ~50% damage even with burn). If Zapdos switches or uses non-Electric, reassess; predict Tbolt lock-in. Track damage calc: Lanturn Spa 276 halved to ~138 effective, Zapdos SpD ~200-250, Surf base 95, should 2HKO if no Roost. My Lanturn post-turn: +Volt Absorb heal (~25-30% from Tbolt) +6.25% Leftovers -12.5% burn, net positive to ~55-60%. Next: If Zapdos low, stay to finish; else switch Medicham for Rock Slide revenge (super on Zapdos). Deoxys Taunt/Toxic priority on any setup from Zapdos or switches (e.g., if Groudon/Kyogre hidden). Opp remaining mons: Deoxys 56%, Medicham 43%, unknown fourth (suspect ground/water counter). Win path: Wall/chip Zapdos with Lanturn, revenge with Medicham Rock Slide, status Deoxys/Medicham with Deoxys, sweep with Charizard Belly Drum.\n\nOpp Zapdos confirmed special attacker (Tbolt STAB), likely set: Leftovers, possible Drill Peck/HP Ice/Roost/Twave. Surf calc: Lanturn SpA 276 vs Zapdos SpD ~200-250, base 95 Water neutral ≈35-45% damage at 61% HP (possible KO with variance). If survives, Medicham Rock Slide (super effective on Flying) for revenge. Preserve Deoxys 56% for Taunt/Toxic on opp setups (remaining unknown mon likely ground/water counter to Charizard). Opp team: Charizard FNT, Lanturn 63% BRN (Surf/Tbolt, walls electrics), Deoxys 56% (support Recover), Medicham 43% (physical?); suspect fourth as Snorlax/Metagross/Kyogre. Win path: KO Zapdos here, status opp walls with Deoxys Toxic, break with Medicham Band Brick Break/Rock Slide, late Charizard Drum + Double Edge sweep. Avoid locking Medicham into wrong move; predict opp switches to ground-immune on Electric threat."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Zapdos is at critically low 20% HP after two Surfs from Lanturn. A third Surf will almost certainly KO it, as previous Surfs dealt approximately 45% and 47% damage respectively, and the remaining HP is well within range of another hit considering Lanturn's high SpA and STAB. Opponent is unlikely to switch out a low-HP mon without gaining something, and even if they do (e.g., to Deoxys), Surf is neutral on Deoxys and chips it further while maintaining pressure. Staying in is low-risk for Lanturn, as Zapdos's coverage moves like Ice Beam would be resisted, Drill Peck neutral and not threatening a KO on bulky burned HP. Thunderbolt would heal me via Volt Absorb, so opponent avoids that. Securing this KO removes a major speed and special threat, allowing momentum shift to revenge kill Deoxys next with Medicham Shadow Ball (super effective on Psychic). Avoid Rest/Sleep Talk as unnecessary with HP stable.", "action": "surf", "scratchpad": "Opp Zapdos set: Pressure/Leftovers/Thunderbolt special; probable Roost/Ice Beam/Drill Peck/HP Ice.

Assume standard Ubers set. Track any revealed moves/abilities. My strategy: Deoxys for speed control and support (Taunt/Toxic to cripple setup sweepers). Medicham as Choice Band Pure Power wallbreaker for revenge killing. Charizard Belly Drum sweeper late-game with Salac for speed boost. Lanturn as special tank with Volt Absorb/Water absorb potential threats. Win conditions: Disable opponent setups early, break walls with Medicham/Charizard, stall with Lanturn/Deoxys Recover. Watch for opponent's other team members; prioritize removing threats to my sweepers like potential Waters or Rocks.\n\nCurrent state: My Deoxys at full after Recover vs. Opp Charizard full. Opp team revealed: Deoxys-Speed (Pressure, Leftovers, likely support), Charizard (Blaze, unknown item/moves beyond possible Fire). Next: Taunt to block setup, or Toxic for chip damage. If Charizard sacs or switches, pivot to Medicham for Choice Band Brick Break/Rock Slide on threats. Track damage: My Fire Blast chipped Deoxys to 52% initially. Long-term: Use Deoxys to status/harass, then sweep with Medicham/Charizard.\n\nOpp Charizard vs Lanturn now; likely Fire Blast, but if EQ predicted unlikely. Lanturn Tbolt OHKOs. If opp switches out, pursue with status from Deoxys later. Deoxys preserved at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setup threats. Opp revealed: Deoxys-Speed support (Recover, Pressure, Leftovers), Charizard offensive (Blaze, likely Fire Blast, possible EQ/Belly Drum). Track damage: Lanturn can tank 2x Fire Blast (~44%), 1x EQ (~82%). Win con: Remove Charizard, then use Medicham to break, Deoxys status control.\n\nOpponent's Charizard: Special attacker confirmed (Fire Blast x2), low EQ likelihood. Tbolt should chunk to ~20-40% HP. Lanturn post-turn ~9% but alive; consider Rest if pressured later. Deoxys at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setups. Medicham preserved for wallbreaking. Watch for opponent revenge kill or switch to Ground/anti-Lanturn. Next: Finish Charizard if low, or pivot if switch.\n\nSwitched to own Charizard to counter potential EQ/Fire Blast safely. Opponent Charizard confirmed: Blaze, Salac Berry (consumed), Fire Blast user, likely EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace possible. Post-KO, assess opponent's switch-in: prioritize Taunt/Toxic with Deoxys on setups, or Medicham wallbreak. Lanturn preserved at ~26% for future tanking Volt Absorb threats. Win con: Use Deoxys status control, Medicham breaks, own Charizard sweeps post-Drum if safe.\n\nHP correction: My Charizard ~2% (preserve for setup sweep); Medicham/Lanturn/Deoxys full HP. Opponent Charizard full HP, special Fire Blast user (Blaze, possible EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum); Deoxys-Speed (Pressure/Leftovers/Recover/Taunt? support); Lanturn (Volt Absorb/Leftovers/brn 26%/Thunderbolt/Surf). Fourth opp mon unknown—anticipate water/ground/steel threat. Post-switch, Medicham locks Rock Slide to remove flying/fire threats; if opp switches to ground-weak, pivot to Brick Break. Use Deoxys Taunt/Toxic on predicted setups (e.g., opp Drum). Lanturn rests if needed, absorbs electrics. Win path: Eliminate opp Charizard now, status Deoxys/Lanturn, then Medicham breaks walls, Charizard sweeps. Avoid double switches; predict opp sac if low.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item/moves; assume standard set (Tbolt, Drill Peck, HP Ice/Ground, Roost?); special attacker likely. Revealing more of opponent's team (remaining 2 unknown; watch for waters/grounds/steels as counters to my Charizard/Medicham). My Medicham preserved at 43% for future wallbreaking (prioritize Brick Break on normals/steels, Rock Slide on flyers/fires, Shadow Ball on psychics/ghosts; avoid locking into resisted moves). Lanturn post-switch: ~26% brn, use to absorb electrics and chip with Surf/Tbolt; consider Rest if HP drops further. Deoxys at 56%: keep for speed control, Taunt on setups (e.g., if opp Kyogre/Groudon), Toxic walls. Charizard at 100%, Salac uneaten?: save for Belly Drum sweep late-game after threats removed. Win path: Wall Zapdos with Lanturn, KO with Surf if chipped, then Medicham revenges, Deoxys statuses remainer, Charizard closes. Track if Zapdos switches out predictably.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item (assume standard Leftovers/Roost set), moves include Thunderbolt (Electric STAB), likely Drill Peck (Flying STAB super on Fighting/Psychic), possible HP Ice/Ground for coverage, Roost for recovery. Volt Absorb perfectly walls Electric moves—heal and counter with Surf (super effective, predicted ~50% damage even with burn). If Zapdos switches or uses non-Electric, reassess; predict Tbolt lock-in. Track damage calc: Lanturn Spa 276 halved to ~138 effective, Zapdos SpD ~200-250, Surf base 95, should 2HKO if no Roost. My Lanturn post-turn: +Volt Absorb heal (~25-30% from Tbolt) +6.25% Leftovers -12.5% burn, net positive to ~55-60%. Next: If Zapdos low, stay to finish; else switch Medicham for Rock Slide revenge (super on Zapdos). Deoxys Taunt/Toxic priority on any setup from Zapdos or switches (e.g., if Groudon/Kyogre hidden). Opp remaining mons: Deoxys 56%, Medicham 43%, unknown fourth (suspect ground/water counter). Win path: Wall/chip Zapdos with Lanturn, revenge with Medicham Rock Slide, status Deoxys/Medicham with Deoxys, sweep with Charizard Belly Drum.\n\nOpp Zapdos confirmed special attacker (Tbolt STAB), likely set: Leftovers, possible Drill Peck/HP Ice/Roost/Twave. Surf calc: Lanturn SpA 276 vs Zapdos SpD ~200-250, base 95 Water neutral ≈35-45% damage at 61% HP (possible KO with variance). If survives, Medicham Rock Slide (super effective on Flying) for revenge. Preserve Deoxys 56% for Taunt/Toxic on opp setups (remaining unknown mon likely ground/water counter to Charizard). Opp team: Charizard FNT, Lanturn 63% BRN (Surf/Tbolt, walls electrics), Deoxys 56% (support Recover), Medicham 43% (physical?); suspect fourth as Snorlax/Metagross/Kyogre. Win path: KO Zapdos here, status opp walls with Deoxys Toxic, break with Medicham Band Brick Break/Rock Slide, late Charizard Drum + Double Edge sweep. Avoid locking Medicham into wrong move; predict opp switches to ground-immune on Electric threat.\n\nOpp Zapdos set: Pressure/Leftovers/Thunderbolt special; probable Roost/Ice Beam/Drill Peck/HP Ice. Surf 3HKO confirmed. Post-KO, predict Deoxys switch (56% HP, support); revenge with Medicham Shadow Ball OHKO potential. Unknown opp mon likely stall (Blissey) or counter (Garchomp/Metagross); use Deoxys Toxic on walls, Charizard Drum if setup safe. Medicham avoid locking into resisted (e.g., no Brick Break on Ghosts). Lanturn post-KO: ~82% brn, pivot to absorb more Electrics if needed."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent has switched in Metagross at full HP against my burned Lanturn at 87%. Metagross (Steel/Psychic) likely carries Earthquake (2x on Lanturn due to Electric weakness) or Meteor Mash (neutral). Lanturn's Thunderbolt is resisted by Steel, Surf is neutral, and unlikely to threaten seriously due to burn and Metagross bulk. Rest/Sleep Talk is stall but not ideal. Switching is safer. Charizard (Fire/Flying) is immune to Ground (EQ), resists Steel (0.5x Meteor Mash), and can threaten back with super-effective Fire Blast (2x on Steel; potential OHKO or heavy damage based on standard sets ~300 SpA vs ~200 SpD).

Assume standard Ubers set. Track any revealed moves/abilities. My strategy: Deoxys for speed control and support (Taunt/Toxic to cripple setup sweepers). Medicham as Choice Band Pure Power wallbreaker for revenge killing. Charizard Belly Drum sweeper late-game with Salac for speed boost. Lanturn as special tank with Volt Absorb/Water absorb potential threats. Win conditions: Disable opponent setups early, break walls with Medicham/Charizard, stall with Lanturn/Deoxys Recover. Watch for opponent's other team members; prioritize removing threats to my sweepers like potential Waters or Rocks.\n\nCurrent state: My Deoxys at full after Recover vs. Opp Charizard full. Opp team revealed: Deoxys-Speed (Pressure, Leftovers, likely support), Charizard (Blaze, unknown item/moves beyond possible Fire). Next: Taunt to block setup, or Toxic for chip damage. If Charizard sacs or switches, pivot to Medicham for Choice Band Brick Break/Rock Slide on threats. Track damage: My Fire Blast chipped Deoxys to 52% initially. Long-term: Use Deoxys to status/harass, then sweep with Medicham/Charizard.\n\nOpp Charizard vs Lanturn now; likely Fire Blast, but if EQ predicted unlikely. Lanturn Tbolt OHKOs. If opp switches out, pursue with status from Deoxys later. Deoxys preserved at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setup threats. Opp revealed: Deoxys-Speed support (Recover, Pressure, Leftovers), Charizard offensive (Blaze, likely Fire Blast, possible EQ/Belly Drum). Track damage: Lanturn can tank 2x Fire Blast (~44%), 1x EQ (~82%). Win con: Remove Charizard, then use Medicham to break, Deoxys status control.\n\nOpponent's Charizard: Special attacker confirmed (Fire Blast x2), low EQ likelihood. Tbolt should chunk to ~20-40% HP. Lanturn post-turn ~9% but alive; consider Rest if pressured later. Deoxys at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setups. Medicham preserved for wallbreaking. Watch for opponent revenge kill or switch to Ground/anti-Lanturn. Next: Finish Charizard if low, or pivot if switch.\n\nSwitched to own Charizard to counter potential EQ/Fire Blast safely. Opponent Charizard confirmed: Blaze, Salac Berry (consumed), Fire Blast user, likely EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace possible. Post-KO, assess opponent's switch-in: prioritize Taunt/Toxic with Deoxys on setups, or Medicham wallbreak. Lanturn preserved at ~26% for future tanking Volt Absorb threats. Win con: Use Deoxys status control, Medicham breaks, own Charizard sweeps post-Drum if safe.\n\nHP correction: My Charizard ~2% (preserve for setup sweep); Medicham/Lanturn/Deoxys full HP. Opponent Charizard full HP, special Fire Blast user (Blaze, possible EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum); Deoxys-Speed (Pressure/Leftovers/Recover/Taunt? support); Lanturn (Volt Absorb/Leftovers/brn 26%/Thunderbolt/Surf). Fourth opp mon unknown—anticipate water/ground/steel threat. Post-switch, Medicham locks Rock Slide to remove flying/fire threats; if opp switches to ground-weak, pivot to Brick Break. Use Deoxys Taunt/Toxic on predicted setups (e.g., opp Drum). Lanturn rests if needed, absorbs electrics. Win path: Eliminate opp Charizard now, status Deoxys/Lanturn, then Medicham breaks walls, Charizard sweeps. Avoid double switches; predict opp sac if low.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item/moves; assume standard set (Tbolt, Drill Peck, HP Ice/Ground, Roost?); special attacker likely. Revealing more of opponent's team (remaining 2 unknown; watch for waters/grounds/steels as counters to my Charizard/Medicham). My Medicham preserved at 43% for future wallbreaking (prioritize Brick Break on normals/steels, Rock Slide on flyers/fires, Shadow Ball on psychics/ghosts; avoid locking into resisted moves). Lanturn post-switch: ~26% brn, use to absorb electrics and chip with Surf/Tbolt; consider Rest if HP drops further. Deoxys at 56%: keep for speed control, Taunt on setups (e.g., if opp Kyogre/Groudon), Toxic walls. Charizard at 100%, Salac uneaten?: save for Belly Drum sweep late-game after threats removed. Win path: Wall Zapdos with Lanturn, KO with Surf if chipped, then Medicham revenges, Deoxys statuses remainer, Charizard closes. Track if Zapdos switches out predictably.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item (assume standard Leftovers/Roost set), moves include Thunderbolt (Electric STAB), likely Drill Peck (Flying STAB super on Fighting/Psychic), possible HP Ice/Ground for coverage, Roost for recovery. Volt Absorb perfectly walls Electric moves—heal and counter with Surf (super effective, predicted ~50% damage even with burn). If Zapdos switches or uses non-Electric, reassess; predict Tbolt lock-in. Track damage calc: Lanturn Spa 276 halved to ~138 effective, Zapdos SpD ~200-250, Surf base 95, should 2HKO if no Roost. My Lanturn post-turn: +Volt Absorb heal (~25-30% from Tbolt) +6.25% Leftovers -12.5% burn, net positive to ~55-60%. Next: If Zapdos low, stay to finish; else switch Medicham for Rock Slide revenge (super on Zapdos). Deoxys Taunt/Toxic priority on any setup from Zapdos or switches (e.g., if Groudon/Kyogre hidden). Opp remaining mons: Deoxys 56%, Medicham 43%, unknown fourth (suspect ground/water counter). Win path: Wall/chip Zapdos with Lanturn, revenge with Medicham Rock Slide, status Deoxys/Medicham with Deoxys, sweep with Charizard Belly Drum.\n\nOpp Zapdos confirmed special attacker (Tbolt STAB), likely set: Leftovers, possible Drill Peck/HP Ice/Roost/Twave. Surf calc: Lanturn SpA 276 vs Zapdos SpD ~200-250, base 95 Water neutral ≈35-45% damage at 61% HP (possible KO with variance). If survives, Medicham Rock Slide (super effective on Flying) for revenge. Preserve Deoxys 56% for Taunt/Toxic on opp setups (remaining unknown mon likely ground/water counter to Charizard). Opp team: Charizard FNT, Lanturn 63% BRN (Surf/Tbolt, walls electrics), Deoxys 56% (support Recover), Medicham 43% (physical?); suspect fourth as Snorlax/Metagross/Kyogre. Win path: KO Zapdos here, status opp walls with Deoxys Toxic, break with Medicham Band Brick Break/Rock Slide, late Charizard Drum + Double Edge sweep. Avoid locking Medicham into wrong move; predict opp switches to ground-immune on Electric threat.\n\nOpp Zapdos set: Pressure/Leftovers/Thunderbolt special; probable Roost/Ice Beam/Drill Peck/HP Ice. Surf 3HKO confirmed. Post-KO, predict Deoxys switch (56% HP, support); revenge with Medicham Shadow Ball OHKO potential. Unknown opp mon likely stall (Blissey) or counter (Garchomp/Metagross); use Deoxys Toxic on walls, Charizard Drum if setup safe. Medicham avoid locking into resisted (e.g., no Brick Break on Ghosts). Lanturn post-KO: ~82% brn, pivot to absorb more Electrics if needed.\n\nOpp Metagross: Clear Body, unknown item (likely Choice Band/Scarf or Life Orb), probable moves: Meteor Mash (Steel STAB), Zen Headbutt (Psychic STAB), Earthquake (coverage), Bullet Punch (priority Steel). Physical attacker ~300 Atk; threatens Fighters/Psychics/Ground-weak. Fire Blast from my Charizard (284 SpA) vs Metagross ~200 SpD: ~70-90% damage predicted, possible KO with miss risk or if Choice Specs. If survives, follow with Earthquake from Charizard (neutral). Opp team full reveal: Deoxys-Speed 56% support, Lanturn 87% BRN tank, Medicham 43% wallbreaker, Charizard/Zapdos FNT; no more unknowns. Win path: Remove Metagross with Charizard Fire Blast/EQ, Toxic stallers (Deoxys/Lanturn) with my Deoxys, revenge with Medicham Band Brick Break/Rock Slide, then Charizard Belly Drum + Double Edge sweep remnants. Watch for Metagross priority Bullet Punch on switch (neutral on Charizard)."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Metagross is Steel/Psychic, making it 2x weak to Fire and Ground moves. My Charizard's Fire Blast is STAB and super effective, with 284 SpA likely chunking or KOing Metagross (estimated 70-90%+ damage based on typical SpD). Earthquake is also super effective but lacks STAB, so less optimal. Belly Drum risks setup against Metagross's potential Meteor Mash or priority Bullet Punch. Double-Edge is neutral and causes recoil, suboptimal. Charizard is immune to opponent's known Earthquake due to Flying type, so safe to attack.

Assume standard Ubers set. Track any revealed moves/abilities. My strategy: Deoxys for speed control and support (Taunt/Toxic to cripple setup sweepers). Medicham as Choice Band Pure Power wallbreaker for revenge killing. Charizard Belly Drum sweeper late-game with Salac for speed boost. Lanturn as special tank with Volt Absorb/Water absorb potential threats. Win conditions: Disable opponent setups early, break walls with Medicham/Charizard, stall with Lanturn/Deoxys Recover. Watch for opponent's other team members; prioritize removing threats to my sweepers like potential Waters or Rocks.\n\nCurrent state: My Deoxys at full after Recover vs. Opp Charizard full. Opp team revealed: Deoxys-Speed (Pressure, Leftovers, likely support), Charizard (Blaze, unknown item/moves beyond possible Fire). Next: Taunt to block setup, or Toxic for chip damage. If Charizard sacs or switches, pivot to Medicham for Choice Band Brick Break/Rock Slide on threats. Track damage: My Fire Blast chipped Deoxys to 52% initially. Long-term: Use Deoxys to status/harass, then sweep with Medicham/Charizard.\n\nOpp Charizard vs Lanturn now; likely Fire Blast, but if EQ predicted unlikely. Lanturn Tbolt OHKOs. If opp switches out, pursue with status from Deoxys later. Deoxys preserved at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setup threats. Opp revealed: Deoxys-Speed support (Recover, Pressure, Leftovers), Charizard offensive (Blaze, likely Fire Blast, possible EQ/Belly Drum). Track damage: Lanturn can tank 2x Fire Blast (~44%), 1x EQ (~82%). Win con: Remove Charizard, then use Medicham to break, Deoxys status control.\n\nOpponent's Charizard: Special attacker confirmed (Fire Blast x2), low EQ likelihood. Tbolt should chunk to ~20-40% HP. Lanturn post-turn ~9% but alive; consider Rest if pressured later. Deoxys at 56% for Taunt/Toxic on setups. Medicham preserved for wallbreaking. Watch for opponent revenge kill or switch to Ground/anti-Lanturn. Next: Finish Charizard if low, or pivot if switch.\n\nSwitched to own Charizard to counter potential EQ/Fire Blast safely. Opponent Charizard confirmed: Blaze, Salac Berry (consumed), Fire Blast user, likely EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace possible. Post-KO, assess opponent's switch-in: prioritize Taunt/Toxic with Deoxys on setups, or Medicham wallbreak. Lanturn preserved at ~26% for future tanking Volt Absorb threats. Win con: Use Deoxys status control, Medicham breaks, own Charizard sweeps post-Drum if safe.\n\nHP correction: My Charizard ~2% (preserve for setup sweep); Medicham/Lanturn/Deoxys full HP. Opponent Charizard full HP, special Fire Blast user (Blaze, possible EQ/Dragon Claw/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum); Deoxys-Speed (Pressure/Leftovers/Recover/Taunt? support); Lanturn (Volt Absorb/Leftovers/brn 26%/Thunderbolt/Surf). Fourth opp mon unknown—anticipate water/ground/steel threat. Post-switch, Medicham locks Rock Slide to remove flying/fire threats; if opp switches to ground-weak, pivot to Brick Break. Use Deoxys Taunt/Toxic on predicted setups (e.g., opp Drum). Lanturn rests if needed, absorbs electrics. Win path: Eliminate opp Charizard now, status Deoxys/Lanturn, then Medicham breaks walls, Charizard sweeps. Avoid double switches; predict opp sac if low.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item/moves; assume standard set (Tbolt, Drill Peck, HP Ice/Ground, Roost?); special attacker likely. Revealing more of opponent's team (remaining 2 unknown; watch for waters/grounds/steels as counters to my Charizard/Medicham). My Medicham preserved at 43% for future wallbreaking (prioritize Brick Break on normals/steels, Rock Slide on flyers/fires, Shadow Ball on psychics/ghosts; avoid locking into resisted moves). Lanturn post-switch: ~26% brn, use to absorb electrics and chip with Surf/Tbolt; consider Rest if HP drops further. Deoxys at 56%: keep for speed control, Taunt on setups (e.g., if opp Kyogre/Groudon), Toxic walls. Charizard at 100%, Salac uneaten?: save for Belly Drum sweep late-game after threats removed. Win path: Wall Zapdos with Lanturn, KO with Surf if chipped, then Medicham revenges, Deoxys statuses remainer, Charizard closes. Track if Zapdos switches out predictably.\n\nOpponent's Zapdos: Pressure, unknown item (assume standard Leftovers/Roost set), moves include Thunderbolt (Electric STAB), likely Drill Peck (Flying STAB super on Fighting/Psychic), possible HP Ice/Ground for coverage, Roost for recovery. Volt Absorb perfectly walls Electric moves—heal and counter with Surf (super effective, predicted ~50% damage even with burn). If Zapdos switches or uses non-Electric, reassess; predict Tbolt lock-in. Track damage calc: Lanturn Spa 276 halved to ~138 effective, Zapdos SpD ~200-250, Surf base 95, should 2HKO if no Roost. My Lanturn post-turn: +Volt Absorb heal (~25-30% from Tbolt) +6.25% Leftovers -12.5% burn, net positive to ~55-60%. Next: If Zapdos low, stay to finish; else switch Medicham for Rock Slide revenge (super on Zapdos). Deoxys Taunt/Toxic priority on any setup from Zapdos or switches (e.g., if Groudon/Kyogre hidden). Opp remaining mons: Deoxys 56%, Medicham 43%, unknown fourth (suspect ground/water counter). Win path: Wall/chip Zapdos with Lanturn, revenge with Medicham Rock Slide, status Deoxys/Medicham with Deoxys, sweep with Charizard Belly Drum.\n\nOpp Zapdos confirmed special attacker (Tbolt STAB), likely set: Leftovers, possible Drill Peck/HP Ice/Roost/Twave. Surf calc: Lanturn SpA 276 vs Zapdos SpD ~200-250, base 95 Water neutral ≈35-45% damage at 61% HP (possible KO with variance). If survives, Medicham Rock Slide (super effective on Flying) for revenge. Preserve Deoxys 56% for Taunt/Toxic on opp setups (remaining unknown mon likely ground/water counter to Charizard). Opp team: Charizard FNT, Lanturn 63% BRN (Surf/Tbolt, walls electrics), Deoxys 56% (support Recover), Medicham 43% (physical?); suspect fourth as Snorlax/Metagross/Kyogre. Win path: KO Zapdos here, status opp walls with Deoxys Toxic, break with Medicham Band Brick Break/Rock Slide, late Charizard Drum + Double Edge sweep. Avoid locking Medicham into wrong move; predict opp switches to ground-immune on Electric threat.\n\nOpp Zapdos set: Pressure/Leftovers/Thunderbolt special; probable Roost/Ice Beam/Drill Peck/HP Ice. Surf 3HKO confirmed. Post-KO, predict Deoxys switch (56% HP, support); revenge with Medicham Shadow Ball OHKO potential. Unknown opp mon likely stall (Blissey) or counter (Garchomp/Metagross); use Deoxys Toxic on walls, Charizard Drum if setup safe. Medicham avoid locking into resisted (e.g., no Brick Break on Ghosts). Lanturn post-KO: ~82% brn, pivot to absorb more Electrics if needed.\n\nOpp Metagross: Clear Body, unknown item (likely Choice Band/Scarf or Life Orb), probable moves: Meteor Mash (Steel STAB), Zen Headbutt (Psychic STAB), Earthquake (coverage), Bullet Punch (priority Steel). Physical attacker ~300 Atk; threatens Fighters/Psychics/Ground-weak. Fire Blast from my Charizard (284 SpA) vs Metagross ~200 SpD: ~70-90% damage predicted, possible KO with miss risk or if Choice Specs. If survives, follow with Earthquake from Charizard (neutral). Opp team full reveal: Deoxys-Speed 56% support, Lanturn 87% BRN tank, Medicham 43% wallbreaker, Charizard/Zapdos FNT; no more unknowns. Win path: Remove Metagross with Charizard Fire Blast/EQ, Toxic stallers (Deoxys/Lanturn) with my Deoxys, revenge with Medicham Band Brick Break/Rock Slide, then Charizard Belly Drum + Double Edge sweep remnants. Watch for Metagross priority Bullet Punch on switch (neutral on Charizard).\n\nOpp Metagross: Clear Body, physical likely (Meteor Mash/EQ/Bullet Punch/Zen Headbutt); Fire Blast should heavy damage/KO. If KO, target opp Lanturn (87% BRN) with Medicham Rock Slide or Deoxys Knock Off; Toxic walls with Deoxys. If survives, revenge Medicham Brick Break (super). Preserve Charizard for late Drum sweep. Opp threats: Lanturn tanks specials but weak to Rock; Deoxys speedy support but frail; Medicham 43% potential revenge. Win path: Eliminate Metagross, status/break weakened team, Charizard closes."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Charizard is active at full HP against the opponent's Metagross at full HP. Charizard's Flying typing makes it immune to Metagross's known move, Earthquake. Charizard's Speed (270) likely outspeeds Metagross (base 70 Speed, max ~193). Fire Blast is a super effective special STAB move against Metagross's Steel typing, with Charizard's SpA of 284 poised to OHKO or heavily damage it (predicted 70-90%+ damage, likely KO based on standard calcs). If it misses (85% accuracy), Metagross cannot harm Charizard with EQ, allowing a safe retry. Other moves are suboptimal: Belly Drum risks setup without guaranteed sweep, Double-Edge is neutral with recoil, Earthquake is redundant since Metagross likely takes it neutrally but Fire is better coverage.

My attacking moves are ineffective: Earthquake is ineffective due to Flying type immunity, Fire Blast is resisted, and Double-Edge is neutral but not setup yet.

Medicham has Pure Power (doubling Attack to ~480 base stat, then Choice Band to ~720 effective), making it a powerful wallbreaker. On switch-in, it can use Fake Out (priority +3), which will flinch the opponent's Charizard if they attack, preventing their move and dealing 30% damage. This grants a free turn. Next turn, Rock Slide will be super effective (Rock vs Fire/Flying) and likely OHKO the opponent.

Likely special attacker with Fire Blast or similar. Medicham Choice Band locked after first move; plan Rock Slide next if not fainted. Watch for opponent's team reveals. Win con: Use Medicham to break early, then Deoxys for utility or Lanturn for bulky water check. Preserve Charizard for late-game sweep with Belly Drum + Salac.\n\nOpp Charizard likely special attacker, survived initial miss; Rock Slide should KO. After this, predict opp switch to unknown threat—watch for water/ground types vs our fire weaknesses. Medicham locked into Rock Slide post-move, so pivot if needed. Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for utility, Charizard for late sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress: Sturdy, unknown item/moves, likely defensive with Rapid Spin/Explosion/Toxic/Spikes. Rock Slide chunks it ~70-90%, sets up KO next turn or trade. Post-move, predict opp Explosion or switch to water/ground vs our Rock lock; pivot to Lanturn if electric-weak threat or Deoxys for speed control. Preserve Medicham for breaking walls, Charizard for +6 sweep later.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn to tank Forretress; expect Explosion (survivable ~70% damage), Spikes, Toxic, or Gyro Ball. If Explosion, KO Forretress next with Surf/TBolt (neutral but Lanturn SpA strong). Medicham safe, relock on return. Opp remaining team unknown beyond fainted Charizard; watch for Ubers like Gengar, Kyogre, etc. Maintain Deoxys for Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard for late +6 Salac sweep.\n\nForretress KO'd. Opp next mon: anticipate Ubers (Kyogre: TBolt/switch Medicham Brick Break; Groudon: Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt/Rock Slide). Lanturn checks waters; use Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Medicham Rock Slide lock: favors vs flying/psychic, risk vs ground. Charizard +6 Salac sweep late-game. My side has Spikes (1/8 on switches).\n\nForretress likely KO'd this turn via Surf; Explosion risk but survivable. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two unknowns—anticipate Ubers like Kyogre (TBolt counters), Groudon (switch to Medicham Brick Break or Charizard EQ), Rayquaza (TBolt or Rock Slide from Medicham). Spikes active on opp side. Post-KO, predict opp switch: to water/ground? Stay in Lanturn if safe, or pivot to Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Long-term: Medicham breaks early walls, Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility, Lanturn bulky check.\n\nForretress KO via Surf likely; predict opp switch to Uber (Kyogre: stay TBolt; Groudon: switch Medicham Brick Break/Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt or Medicham Rock Slide). No Spikes on opp side, so clean switches for them. Lanturn checks incoming Waters/Electrics; pivot if resisted. Medicham Choice Band for breaking walls post-return, Deoxys Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard +6 Salac late sweep. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two Ubers unknown—watch for type matchups.\n\nOpp Zapdos KO'd via Medicham Rock Slide trade; Medicham ~40% HP, locked Rock Slide. Opp team remaining: two Ubers unknown (likely Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza/Mewtwo/etc.); Rock Slide good vs. Rayquaza/flyers, switch Lanturn vs. Kyogre (TBolt), Charizard EQ vs. Groudon, Deoxys Taunt vs. setup. No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Medicham breaks weakened foes, pivot to Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility (Toxic/KO), Lanturn bulky Electric/Water check.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs weakened Opp Zapdos (63%, Pressure, Leftovers, Thunderbolt). Lanturn TBolt likely KOs (Volt Absorb tanks any Electric). Opp remaining: 1 unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza; pivot Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ vs Ground).

Preserve Medicham for breaking walls, Charizard for +6 sweep later.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn to tank Forretress; expect Explosion (survivable ~70% damage), Spikes, Toxic, or Gyro Ball. If Explosion, KO Forretress next with Surf/TBolt (neutral but Lanturn SpA strong). Medicham safe, relock on return. Opp remaining team unknown beyond fainted Charizard; watch for Ubers like Gengar, Kyogre, etc. Maintain Deoxys for Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard for late +6 Salac sweep.\n\nForretress KO'd. Opp next mon: anticipate Ubers (Kyogre: TBolt/switch Medicham Brick Break; Groudon: Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt/Rock Slide). Lanturn checks waters; use Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Medicham Rock Slide lock: favors vs flying/psychic, risk vs ground. Charizard +6 Salac sweep late-game. My side has Spikes (1/8 on switches).\n\nForretress likely KO'd this turn via Surf; Explosion risk but survivable. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two unknowns—anticipate Ubers like Kyogre (TBolt counters), Groudon (switch to Medicham Brick Break or Charizard EQ), Rayquaza (TBolt or Rock Slide from Medicham). Spikes active on opp side. Post-KO, predict opp switch: to water/ground? Stay in Lanturn if safe, or pivot to Deoxys Taunt vs setup.

No Spikes on opp side, so clean switches for them. Lanturn checks incoming Waters/Electrics; pivot if resisted.

No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Medicham breaks weakened foes, pivot to Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility (Toxic/KO), Lanturn bulky Electric/Water check.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs weakened Opp Zapdos (63%, Pressure, Leftovers, Thunderbolt). Lanturn TBolt likely KOs (Volt Absorb tanks any Electric). Opp remaining: 1 unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza; pivot Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ vs Ground). My remaining: Charizard +6 Salac potential, Deoxys utility (Taunt/Toxic/Recover), Forretress low HP for Spikes support. No Spikes on my side; clean switches.\n\nOpp Forretress ~13% HP, vulnerable to Surf OHKO on switch-in. Zapdos 69%, Pressure/Leftovers, TBolt confirmed—absorb and retaliate. Unknown Uber: predict Kyogre (TBolt OHKO, Surf resisted—prefer stay/TBolt if switches); Groudon (pivot to Charizard +6 EQ/ Belly Drum sweep); Rayquaza (Surf neutral chip, or Deoxys Taunt/Knock Off). No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep vs grounds/flying, Deoxys Speed for Taunt utility and speed control vs setup (Toxic walls), Lanturn as bulky Electric/Water pivot absorbing Electrics.

Previous Surf from Lanturn dealt approximately 31% damage to Zapdos (from 63% to 32%), so another Surf should reduce it to about 1%, nearly KOing it while maintaining safety. If opponent switches to Forretress at 13%, Surf will likely OHKO it even with Steel's resistance (previous full-power Surfs chunked Forretress significantly, e.g., 61% on first hit). Thunderbolt would be resisted by Zapdos (Electric vs Electric/Flying) and deal less damage, so Surf maximizes pressure. Switching to Deoxys risks unnecessary damage from Thunderbolt (neutral on Psychic) when Lanturn can absorb and retaliate safely.

Likely special attacker with Fire Blast or similar. Medicham Choice Band locked after first move; plan Rock Slide next if not fainted. Watch for opponent's team reveals. Win con: Use Medicham to break early, then Deoxys for utility or Lanturn for bulky water check. Preserve Charizard for late-game sweep with Belly Drum + Salac.\n\nOpp Charizard likely special attacker, survived initial miss; Rock Slide should KO. After this, predict opp switch to unknown threat—watch for water/ground types vs our fire weaknesses. Medicham locked into Rock Slide post-move, so pivot if needed. Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for utility, Charizard for late sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress: Sturdy, unknown item/moves, likely defensive with Rapid Spin/Explosion/Toxic/Spikes. Rock Slide chunks it ~70-90%, sets up KO next turn or trade. Post-move, predict opp Explosion or switch to water/ground vs our Rock lock; pivot to Lanturn if electric-weak threat or Deoxys for speed control. Preserve Medicham for breaking walls, Charizard for +6 sweep later.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn to tank Forretress; expect Explosion (survivable ~70% damage), Spikes, Toxic, or Gyro Ball. If Explosion, KO Forretress next with Surf/TBolt (neutral but Lanturn SpA strong). Medicham safe, relock on return. Opp remaining team unknown beyond fainted Charizard; watch for Ubers like Gengar, Kyogre, etc. Maintain Deoxys for Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard for late +6 Salac sweep.\n\nForretress KO'd. Opp next mon: anticipate Ubers (Kyogre: TBolt/switch Medicham Brick Break; Groudon: Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt/Rock Slide). Lanturn checks waters; use Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Medicham Rock Slide lock: favors vs flying/psychic, risk vs ground. Charizard +6 Salac sweep late-game. My side has Spikes (1/8 on switches).\n\nForretress likely KO'd this turn via Surf; Explosion risk but survivable. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two unknowns—anticipate Ubers like Kyogre (TBolt counters), Groudon (switch to Medicham Brick Break or Charizard EQ), Rayquaza (TBolt or Rock Slide from Medicham). Spikes active on opp side. Post-KO, predict opp switch: to water/ground? Stay in Lanturn if safe, or pivot to Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Long-term: Medicham breaks early walls, Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility, Lanturn bulky check.\n\nForretress KO via Surf likely; predict opp switch to Uber (Kyogre: stay TBolt; Groudon: switch Medicham Brick Break/Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt or Medicham Rock Slide). No Spikes on opp side, so clean switches for them. Lanturn checks incoming Waters/Electrics; pivot if resisted. Medicham Choice Band for breaking walls post-return, Deoxys Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard +6 Salac late sweep. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two Ubers unknown—watch for type matchups.\n\nOpp Zapdos KO'd via Medicham Rock Slide trade; Medicham ~40% HP, locked Rock Slide. Opp team remaining: two Ubers unknown (likely Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza/Mewtwo/etc.); Rock Slide good vs. Rayquaza/flyers, switch Lanturn vs. Kyogre (TBolt), Charizard EQ vs. Groudon, Deoxys Taunt vs. setup. No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Medicham breaks weakened foes, pivot to Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility (Toxic/KO), Lanturn bulky Electric/Water check.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs weakened Opp Zapdos (63%, Pressure, Leftovers, Thunderbolt). Lanturn TBolt likely KOs (Volt Absorb tanks any Electric). Opp remaining: 1 unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza; pivot Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ vs Ground). My remaining: Charizard +6 Salac potential, Deoxys utility (Taunt/Toxic/Recover), Forretress low HP for Spikes support. No Spikes on my side; clean switches.\n\nOpp Forretress ~13% HP, vulnerable to Surf OHKO on switch-in. Zapdos 69%, Pressure/Leftovers, TBolt confirmed—absorb and retaliate. Unknown Uber: predict Kyogre (TBolt OHKO, Surf resisted—prefer stay/TBolt if switches); Groudon (pivot to Charizard +6 EQ/ Belly Drum sweep); Rayquaza (Surf neutral chip, or Deoxys Taunt/Knock Off). No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep vs grounds/flying, Deoxys Speed for Taunt utility and speed control vs setup (Toxic walls), Lanturn as bulky Electric/Water pivot absorbing Electrics. Prioritize KOing Zapdos/Forretress this turn for momentum.\n\nSurf nearly KOs Zapdos (to ~1%); if switch to Forretress 13%, OHKO likely despite resist. Opp Thunderbolt heals Lanturn. Remaining opp: Forretress 13%, unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon: pivot Lanturn TBolt vs Kyogre, Charizard EQ vs Groudon; Rayquaza: Surf/TBolt). Next turn: finish Zapdos/Forretress, then Deoxys Taunt vs setup Uber. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac sweep late if needed, but momentum push now with Lanturn bulky pivot.\n\nForretress KO via Surf; reveals last opp mon (predict Uber: Kyogre - stay TBolt OHKO; Groudon - switch Charizard EQ/Belly Drum setup; Rayquaza - TBolt/Surf; Mewtwo - Deoxys Taunt then Toxic/Knock Off). My 2 Spikes layers hurt switches (~25% to Charizard/Deoxys on entry), so minimize switches post-KO; use Lanturn as pivot if safe. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep vs. grounds/flyers late, Deoxys utility Taunt/Toxic/Recover for control, Lanturn absorbs Electrics/Waters. Opp has clean switches (no hazards their side). Momentum key now to pressure final threat.\n\nKO Metagross this turn; opp Forretress 19% next - easy Surf OHKO. Opp remaining: 1-2 unknown (predict Ubers: Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ/Belly Drum vs Ground, Lanturn TBolt vs Water/Dragon). Minimize switches (25% Spikes damage); Lanturn pivots Electrics/Waters. Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep late if needed, Deoxys Taunt/Toxic utility."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My active Pokemon, Lanturn, has fainted, so I must switch. Opponent's active Metagross is at 55% HP and knows Earthquake, which it will likely use on the incoming Pokemon. Charizard is immune to Ground moves due to its Flying typing, making it a safe switch-in that takes no damage. Deoxys-Speed would take neutral damage from Earthquake and, with its low base Defense (20) and HP (50), risks being KO'd by a strong hit from Metagross, a physical powerhouse. Switching to Charizard positions it well to threaten Metagross next turn with Fire Blast, which is super effective against Steel and should OHKO at 55% HP given Charizard's high Special Attack. This maintains momentum and avoids unnecessary risk.", "action": "charizard", "scratchpad": "Switched to Charizard vs Metagross 55%; immune to EQ. Next turn: Fire Blast for OHKO.

Likely special attacker with Fire Blast or similar. Medicham Choice Band locked after first move; plan Rock Slide next if not fainted. Watch for opponent's team reveals. Win con: Use Medicham to break early, then Deoxys for utility or Lanturn for bulky water check. Preserve Charizard for late-game sweep with Belly Drum + Salac.\n\nOpp Charizard likely special attacker, survived initial miss; Rock Slide should KO. After this, predict opp switch to unknown threat—watch for water/ground types vs our fire weaknesses. Medicham locked into Rock Slide post-move, so pivot if needed. Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for utility, Charizard for late sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress: Sturdy, unknown item/moves, likely defensive with Rapid Spin/Explosion/Toxic/Spikes. Rock Slide chunks it ~70-90%, sets up KO next turn or trade. Post-move, predict opp Explosion or switch to water/ground vs our Rock lock; pivot to Lanturn if electric-weak threat or Deoxys for speed control. Preserve Medicham for breaking walls, Charizard for +6 sweep later.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn to tank Forretress; expect Explosion (survivable ~70% damage), Spikes, Toxic, or Gyro Ball. If Explosion, KO Forretress next with Surf/TBolt (neutral but Lanturn SpA strong). Medicham safe, relock on return. Opp remaining team unknown beyond fainted Charizard; watch for Ubers like Gengar, Kyogre, etc. Maintain Deoxys for Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard for late +6 Salac sweep.\n\nForretress KO'd. Opp next mon: anticipate Ubers (Kyogre: TBolt/switch Medicham Brick Break; Groudon: Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt/Rock Slide). Lanturn checks waters; use Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Medicham Rock Slide lock: favors vs flying/psychic, risk vs ground. Charizard +6 Salac sweep late-game. My side has Spikes (1/8 on switches).\n\nForretress likely KO'd this turn via Surf; Explosion risk but survivable. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two unknowns—anticipate Ubers like Kyogre (TBolt counters), Groudon (switch to Medicham Brick Break or Charizard EQ), Rayquaza (TBolt or Rock Slide from Medicham). Spikes active on opp side. Post-KO, predict opp switch: to water/ground? Stay in Lanturn if safe, or pivot to Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Long-term: Medicham breaks early walls, Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility, Lanturn bulky check.\n\nForretress KO via Surf likely; predict opp switch to Uber (Kyogre: stay TBolt; Groudon: switch Medicham Brick Break/Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt or Medicham Rock Slide). No Spikes on opp side, so clean switches for them. Lanturn checks incoming Waters/Electrics; pivot if resisted. Medicham Choice Band for breaking walls post-return, Deoxys Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard +6 Salac late sweep. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two Ubers unknown—watch for type matchups.\n\nOpp Zapdos KO'd via Medicham Rock Slide trade; Medicham ~40% HP, locked Rock Slide. Opp team remaining: two Ubers unknown (likely Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza/Mewtwo/etc.); Rock Slide good vs. Rayquaza/flyers, switch Lanturn vs. Kyogre (TBolt), Charizard EQ vs. Groudon, Deoxys Taunt vs. setup. No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Medicham breaks weakened foes, pivot to Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility (Toxic/KO), Lanturn bulky Electric/Water check.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs weakened Opp Zapdos (63%, Pressure, Leftovers, Thunderbolt). Lanturn TBolt likely KOs (Volt Absorb tanks any Electric). Opp remaining: 1 unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza; pivot Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ vs Ground). My remaining: Charizard +6 Salac potential, Deoxys utility (Taunt/Toxic/Recover), Forretress low HP for Spikes support. No Spikes on my side; clean switches.\n\nOpp Forretress ~13% HP, vulnerable to Surf OHKO on switch-in. Zapdos 69%, Pressure/Leftovers, TBolt confirmed—absorb and retaliate. Unknown Uber: predict Kyogre (TBolt OHKO, Surf resisted—prefer stay/TBolt if switches); Groudon (pivot to Charizard +6 EQ/ Belly Drum sweep); Rayquaza (Surf neutral chip, or Deoxys Taunt/Knock Off). No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep vs grounds/flying, Deoxys Speed for Taunt utility and speed control vs setup (Toxic walls), Lanturn as bulky Electric/Water pivot absorbing Electrics. Prioritize KOing Zapdos/Forretress this turn for momentum.\n\nSurf nearly KOs Zapdos (to ~1%); if switch to Forretress 13%, OHKO likely despite resist. Opp Thunderbolt heals Lanturn. Remaining opp: Forretress 13%, unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon: pivot Lanturn TBolt vs Kyogre, Charizard EQ vs Groudon; Rayquaza: Surf/TBolt). Next turn: finish Zapdos/Forretress, then Deoxys Taunt vs setup Uber. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac sweep late if needed, but momentum push now with Lanturn bulky pivot.\n\nForretress KO via Surf; reveals last opp mon (predict Uber: Kyogre - stay TBolt OHKO; Groudon - switch Charizard EQ/Belly Drum setup; Rayquaza - TBolt/Surf; Mewtwo - Deoxys Taunt then Toxic/Knock Off). My 2 Spikes layers hurt switches (~25% to Charizard/Deoxys on entry), so minimize switches post-KO; use Lanturn as pivot if safe. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep vs. grounds/flyers late, Deoxys utility Taunt/Toxic/Recover for control, Lanturn absorbs Electrics/Waters. Opp has clean switches (no hazards their side). Momentum key now to pressure final threat.\n\nKO Metagross this turn; opp Forretress 19% next - easy Surf OHKO. Opp remaining: 1-2 unknown (predict Ubers: Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ/Belly Drum vs Ground, Lanturn TBolt vs Water/Dragon). Minimize switches (25% Spikes damage); Lanturn pivots Electrics/Waters. Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep late if needed, Deoxys Taunt/Toxic utility.\n\nSwitched to Charizard vs Metagross 55%; immune to EQ. Next turn: Fire Blast for OHKO. Handle remaining Forretress 19% with EQ (neutral) or Fire Blast if needed. Preserve Deoxys for utility (Taunt/Toxic) vs potential setup threat as last mon. Late-game Charizard +6 Belly Drum Salac sweep viable if walls remain. Opp hazards: 2 Spikes on my side, so minimize future switches."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Charizard is active at full HP against Metagross at 55% HP. Charizard's Flying typing makes it immune to Metagross's Earthquake. Charizard outspeeds Metagross due to higher Speed stat (270 vs. standard Metagross ~70 base). Earthquake from Charizard is super effective against Metagross (Steel typing) and should OHKO it given Charizard's high Attack (293) and Metagross's reduced HP. Fire Blast is resisted by Steel, Double Edge is also resisted by Steel, and Belly Drum is unnecessary risk when a clean KO is available. Switching to Deoxys is suboptimal as it would allow Metagross a free hit, though neutral, and we lose momentum.

Likely special attacker with Fire Blast or similar. Medicham Choice Band locked after first move; plan Rock Slide next if not fainted. Watch for opponent's team reveals. Win con: Use Medicham to break early, then Deoxys for utility or Lanturn for bulky water check. Preserve Charizard for late-game sweep with Belly Drum + Salac.\n\nOpp Charizard likely special attacker, survived initial miss; Rock Slide should KO. After this, predict opp switch to unknown threat—watch for water/ground types vs our fire weaknesses. Medicham locked into Rock Slide post-move, so pivot if needed. Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for utility, Charizard for late sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress: Sturdy, unknown item/moves, likely defensive with Rapid Spin/Explosion/Toxic/Spikes. Rock Slide chunks it ~70-90%, sets up KO next turn or trade. Post-move, predict opp Explosion or switch to water/ground vs our Rock lock; pivot to Lanturn if electric-weak threat or Deoxys for speed control. Preserve Medicham for breaking walls, Charizard for +6 sweep later.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn to tank Forretress; expect Explosion (survivable ~70% damage), Spikes, Toxic, or Gyro Ball. If Explosion, KO Forretress next with Surf/TBolt (neutral but Lanturn SpA strong). Medicham safe, relock on return. Opp remaining team unknown beyond fainted Charizard; watch for Ubers like Gengar, Kyogre, etc. Maintain Deoxys for Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard for late +6 Salac sweep.\n\nForretress KO'd. Opp next mon: anticipate Ubers (Kyogre: TBolt/switch Medicham Brick Break; Groudon: Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt/Rock Slide). Lanturn checks waters; use Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Medicham Rock Slide lock: favors vs flying/psychic, risk vs ground. Charizard +6 Salac sweep late-game. My side has Spikes (1/8 on switches).\n\nForretress likely KO'd this turn via Surf; Explosion risk but survivable. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two unknowns—anticipate Ubers like Kyogre (TBolt counters), Groudon (switch to Medicham Brick Break or Charizard EQ), Rayquaza (TBolt or Rock Slide from Medicham). Spikes active on opp side. Post-KO, predict opp switch: to water/ground? Stay in Lanturn if safe, or pivot to Deoxys Taunt vs setup. Long-term: Medicham breaks early walls, Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility, Lanturn bulky check.\n\nForretress KO via Surf likely; predict opp switch to Uber (Kyogre: stay TBolt; Groudon: switch Medicham Brick Break/Charizard EQ; Rayquaza: TBolt or Medicham Rock Slide). No Spikes on opp side, so clean switches for them. Lanturn checks incoming Waters/Electrics; pivot if resisted. Medicham Choice Band for breaking walls post-return, Deoxys Taunt utility vs setup, Charizard +6 Salac late sweep. Opp team: Charizard FNT, Forretress ~KO, two Ubers unknown—watch for type matchups.\n\nOpp Zapdos KO'd via Medicham Rock Slide trade; Medicham ~40% HP, locked Rock Slide. Opp team remaining: two Ubers unknown (likely Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza/Mewtwo/etc.); Rock Slide good vs. Rayquaza/flyers, switch Lanturn vs. Kyogre (TBolt), Charizard EQ vs. Groudon, Deoxys Taunt vs. setup. No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Medicham breaks weakened foes, pivot to Charizard +6 Salac sweep late, Deoxys utility (Toxic/KO), Lanturn bulky Electric/Water check.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs weakened Opp Zapdos (63%, Pressure, Leftovers, Thunderbolt). Lanturn TBolt likely KOs (Volt Absorb tanks any Electric). Opp remaining: 1 unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza; pivot Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ vs Ground). My remaining: Charizard +6 Salac potential, Deoxys utility (Taunt/Toxic/Recover), Forretress low HP for Spikes support. No Spikes on my side; clean switches.\n\nOpp Forretress ~13% HP, vulnerable to Surf OHKO on switch-in. Zapdos 69%, Pressure/Leftovers, TBolt confirmed—absorb and retaliate. Unknown Uber: predict Kyogre (TBolt OHKO, Surf resisted—prefer stay/TBolt if switches); Groudon (pivot to Charizard +6 EQ/ Belly Drum sweep); Rayquaza (Surf neutral chip, or Deoxys Taunt/Knock Off). No Spikes on opp side. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep vs grounds/flying, Deoxys Speed for Taunt utility and speed control vs setup (Toxic walls), Lanturn as bulky Electric/Water pivot absorbing Electrics. Prioritize KOing Zapdos/Forretress this turn for momentum.\n\nSurf nearly KOs Zapdos (to ~1%); if switch to Forretress 13%, OHKO likely despite resist. Opp Thunderbolt heals Lanturn. Remaining opp: Forretress 13%, unknown Uber (predict Kyogre/Groudon: pivot Lanturn TBolt vs Kyogre, Charizard EQ vs Groudon; Rayquaza: Surf/TBolt). Next turn: finish Zapdos/Forretress, then Deoxys Taunt vs setup Uber. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac sweep late if needed, but momentum push now with Lanturn bulky pivot.\n\nForretress KO via Surf; reveals last opp mon (predict Uber: Kyogre - stay TBolt OHKO; Groudon - switch Charizard EQ/Belly Drum setup; Rayquaza - TBolt/Surf; Mewtwo - Deoxys Taunt then Toxic/Knock Off). My 2 Spikes layers hurt switches (~25% to Charizard/Deoxys on entry), so minimize switches post-KO; use Lanturn as pivot if safe. Long-term: Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep vs. grounds/flyers late, Deoxys utility Taunt/Toxic/Recover for control, Lanturn absorbs Electrics/Waters. Opp has clean switches (no hazards their side). Momentum key now to pressure final threat.\n\nKO Metagross this turn; opp Forretress 19% next - easy Surf OHKO. Opp remaining: 1-2 unknown (predict Ubers: Deoxys Taunt vs setup, Charizard EQ/Belly Drum vs Ground, Lanturn TBolt vs Water/Dragon). Minimize switches (25% Spikes damage); Lanturn pivots Electrics/Waters. Charizard +6 Salac Atk sweep late if needed, Deoxys Taunt/Toxic utility.\n\nSwitched to Charizard vs Metagross 55%; immune to EQ. Next turn: Fire Blast for OHKO. Handle remaining Forretress 19% with EQ (neutral) or Fire Blast if needed. Preserve Deoxys for utility (Taunt/Toxic) vs potential setup threat as last mon. Late-game Charizard +6 Belly Drum Salac sweep viable if walls remain. Opp hazards: 2 Spikes on my side, so minimize future switches.\n\nKO'd Metagross with EQ; opponent last mon likely Forretress ~low HP (19% + LO heals - Spikes 25% on switch: probable faint on entry or easy KO). If not Forretress, anticipate final Uber remnant but momentum favors us. Post-cleanup, Deoxys handles any stall with Taunt/Toxic/Recover. Charizard +6 Belly Drum Salac sweep not needed but viable if extended. Opponent hazards: 2 Spikes on their side (clean for us). Win imminent."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Metagross is at 55% HP and weak to Fire-type moves. Charizard's Fire Blast is a super effective STAB move with high power, likely to OHKO Metagross from our position (high SpA stat of 284). Charizard is immune to Ground moves like the opponent's predicted Earthquake due to Flying typing, making this a safe and optimal play to gain momentum and eliminate another threat.

After Taunt, next turn we can follow up with Toxic to chip damage over time or Knock Off to remove potential item like Salac Berry, wearing down the threat. Switching risks losing momentum, and Recover is unnecessary at full HP. Long-term, this supports preserving our sweepers like Charizard for late-game while disrupting opponent's setup attempts.

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Lanturn vs. Zapdos at 63% HP. Surf is neutral but effective, previously chunking Zapdos for ~43% from full, so this should reduce it to ~20% or KO depending on exact rolls, gaining strong momentum.

Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Zapdos is at critically low 27% HP and is frail. Lanturn's Thunderbolt is super effective against Zapdos's Flying typing (neutral on Electric), and with Lanturn's base 76 SpA boosted to 276, it will easily KO Zapdos before it can act meaningfully. Even if Zapdos uses Thunderbolt, Volt Absorb will heal Lanturn fully, negating any threat. Surf is only neutral and less optimal. No need to switch, as this secures a free KO and momentum. Post-KO, opponent will likely switch; prepare Medicham for revenge killing potential bulky threats like their Charizard or Medicham with Brick Break, or Deoxys for Toxic to apply status on incoming Pokémon like their Lanturn (74%) or Charizard (~94%, itemless).

Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent has switched in Forretress, likely a sacrificial spinner/spiker with Explosion, given Sturdy and common sets. If I attack with Surf or Thunderbolt, it will survive due to Sturdy and probably Explode, KOing my bulky Lanturn (Explosion deals massive neutral damage).

Medicham at 54% has high Defense (186) and can likely survive a Forretress Explosion (low base Atk ~90, even maxed ~200-250 damage est. <50% to Medicham).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Medicham is Choice Band with Pure Power, outspeeding Forretress (base 80 vs 40 Speed). Rock Slide is 4x super effective (Rock vs Steel/Bug) and with CB-boosted power, it should OHKO Forretress before it can use Explosion or any other move. This removes a potential sacrificial Spiker/Spinner without risking Medicham, which is at 54% HP. Other moves are less optimal: Brick Break only 2x super, Shadow Ball neutral, Fake Out flinches but locks us into a weaker move next turn.

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard.\n\nRock Slide OHKO on Forretress predicted; locks Medicham into it for revenge next (strong vs Charizard/Lanturn/Deoxys, neutral but high power). Opponent post-KO switch: likely their Medicham (54%, takes Spikes ~12% dmg on entry, Brick Break revenge super vs it), or Charizard (94% itemless, EQ chunks). Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for support/absorb; position Charizard BD sweep vs remaining weakened team (their Deoxys 36%, Lanturn full but poisonable, Medicham low). Full opp team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress KO soon, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% BD set itemless, Lanturn full Volt Absorb, Deoxys 36% support. Attrit with any remaining Toxic if switch to Deoxys."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Medicham, with Choice Band and Pure Power, used Rock Slide last turn, locking it into that move. Rock Slide will KO my Forretress, which is at 41% HP and cannot be saved by Sturdy since it's not at full health. Staying in to use Rock Slide would deal minimal neutral damage to Medicham before fainting, wasting the turn. Instead, switch to Lanturn, my full-HP bulky Water/Electric tank, which takes neutral damage from Rock Slide and will easily survive (estimated 20-30% damage at most, given Lanturn's high HP and defenses). This allows me to sac Forretress (hazard setter role complete with 2 layers of Spikes up) and gain momentum by bringing in a strong counter to Medicham. Next turn, with Medicham still locked into Rock Slide (ineffective on Lanturn), I can use Surf or Thunderbolt to deal significant neutral damage to Medicham's 54% HP, potentially leaving it near faint or forcing a switch.", "action": "lanturn", "scratchpad": "Forretress sacs to Rock Slide KO; Lanturn switches in to tank neutral hit safely (full HP, Leftovers). Opponent Medicham locked into Rock Slide (weak vs Lanturn). Next: Surf (STAB Water, high SpA) for ~40-50% neutral damage on Medicham (54% remaining), or Tbolt if they switch to Deoxys (neutral Electric vs Psychic). Predict opponent switch post-sac to avoid damage: likely their Charizard (~94%, itemless BD set; Surf super effective 2x as Water > Fire, Flying neutral) or Deoxys (36%; Surf neutral, but Toxic/Recover threat - use Tbolt neutral). Avoid their Lanturn switch-in if possible (Spikes 25% entry to 75%, then my Surf neutral self-match). Their Medicham post-damage prime for my reserve revenge if needed (e.g., Deoxys Toxic or my Charizard EQ super on Steel? Wait, Medicham no Steel). Overall win con: Attrit with Spikes/Leftovers, poison remaining threats with Deoxys if revives, wallbreak/sweep with Charizard BD + Salac (full HP, confirm item intact) vs weakened opp (Deoxys low, Medicham low, Zapdos FNT).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard.\n\nRock Slide OHKO on Forretress predicted; locks Medicham into it for revenge next (strong vs Charizard/Lanturn/Deoxys, neutral but high power). Opponent post-KO switch: likely their Medicham (54%, takes Spikes ~12% dmg on entry, Brick Break revenge super vs it), or Charizard (94% itemless, EQ chunks). Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for support/absorb; position Charizard BD sweep vs remaining weakened team (their Deoxys 36%, Lanturn full but poisonable, Medicham low). Full opp team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress KO soon, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% BD set itemless, Lanturn full Volt Absorb, Deoxys 36% support. Attrit with any remaining Toxic if switch to Deoxys.\n\nForretress sacs to Rock Slide KO; Lanturn switches in to tank neutral hit safely (full HP, Leftovers). Opponent Medicham locked into Rock Slide (weak vs Lanturn). Next: Surf (STAB Water, high SpA) for ~40-50% neutral damage on Medicham (54% remaining), or Tbolt if they switch to Deoxys (neutral Electric vs Psychic). Predict opponent switch post-sac to avoid damage: likely their Charizard (~94%, itemless BD set; Surf super effective 2x as Water > Fire, Flying neutral) or Deoxys (36%; Surf neutral, but Toxic/Recover threat - use Tbolt neutral). Avoid their Lanturn switch-in if possible (Spikes 25% entry to 75%, then my Surf neutral self-match). Their Medicham post-damage prime for my reserve revenge if needed (e.g., Deoxys Toxic or my Charizard EQ super on Steel? Wait, Medicham no Steel). Overall win con: Attrit with Spikes/Leftovers, poison remaining threats with Deoxys if revives, wallbreak/sweep with Charizard BD + Salac (full HP, confirm item intact) vs weakened opp (Deoxys low, Medicham low, Zapdos FNT). Opp reserves: Charizard strong setup threat (Taunt with Deoxys if returns), their Lanturn full tank (my Surf neutral, but Volt Absorb neuters Tbolt), their Forretress/Deoxys support."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Entering turn 18, my active Pokémon is Lanturn at ~90% HP, facing opponent's Forretress at 47% HP. Lanturn's Speed (stat 170) greatly exceeds Forretress's (base 40, likely ~70 stat), ensuring I move first. Surf is a STAB Water move (95 BP, effective 142.5 post-STAB) from Lanturn's high SpA (276), which will easily KO Forretress from its remaining 47 HP as it's neutral typing and low remaining bulk. This prevents Forretress from using Explosion or further Spikes (already at max 3 layers on opponent side). Gaining this KO provides momentum; post-KO, opponent will likely switch to a reserve like their low-HP Medicham (54%, vulnerable to Surf neutral ~40-50% chip) or Charizard (~94%, super effective to Surf 2x). Next turn, continue pressure with Surf on Fire/Water switch-ins or Thunderbolt on others. Preserve Medicham for revenge killing with Brick Break (super effective vs. their Deoxys/Lanturn if they bring them). Deoxys at 36% saved for Taunt/Toxic support. Position full-HP Charizard for late-game Belly Drum + Salac-activation sweep (note: Salac was knocked off earlier per log, but status lists it—assume usable if not consumed; regardless, Charizard remains key sweeper post-attrition).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard.\n\nRock Slide OHKO on Forretress predicted; locks Medicham into it for revenge next (strong vs Charizard/Lanturn/Deoxys, neutral but high power). Opponent post-KO switch: likely their Medicham (54%, takes Spikes ~12% dmg on entry, Brick Break revenge super vs it), or Charizard (94% itemless, EQ chunks). Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for support/absorb; position Charizard BD sweep vs remaining weakened team (their Deoxys 36%, Lanturn full but poisonable, Medicham low). Full opp team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress KO soon, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% BD set itemless, Lanturn full Volt Absorb, Deoxys 36% support. Attrit with any remaining Toxic if switch to Deoxys.\n\nForretress sacs to Rock Slide KO; Lanturn switches in to tank neutral hit safely (full HP, Leftovers). Opponent Medicham locked into Rock Slide (weak vs Lanturn). Next: Surf (STAB Water, high SpA) for ~40-50% neutral damage on Medicham (54% remaining), or Tbolt if they switch to Deoxys (neutral Electric vs Psychic). Predict opponent switch post-sac to avoid damage: likely their Charizard (~94%, itemless BD set; Surf super effective 2x as Water > Fire, Flying neutral) or Deoxys (36%; Surf neutral, but Toxic/Recover threat - use Tbolt neutral). Avoid their Lanturn switch-in if possible (Spikes 25% entry to 75%, then my Surf neutral self-match). Their Medicham post-damage prime for my reserve revenge if needed (e.g., Deoxys Toxic or my Charizard EQ super on Steel? Wait, Medicham no Steel). Overall win con: Attrit with Spikes/Leftovers, poison remaining threats with Deoxys if revives, wallbreak/sweep with Charizard BD + Salac (full HP, confirm item intact) vs weakened opp (Deoxys low, Medicham low, Zapdos FNT). Opp reserves: Charizard strong setup threat (Taunt with Deoxys if returns), their Lanturn full tank (my Surf neutral, but Volt Absorb neuters Tbolt), their Forretress/Deoxys support.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; opp switch prediction: Medicham (low, Surf chips to revenge range for my Medicham Brick Break super? Wait neutral) or Charizard (Surf 2x ~60-70% est., then my Charizard EQ revenge). Their Lanturn remains key tank threat (full, Volt Absorb—avoid Tbolt on it, use Surf neutral ~30-40%). Deoxys for Toxic on switches to poison Charizard/Lanturn for passive damage. Opp full team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress FNT, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% itemless BD set, Lanturn ~90%, Deoxys 36% support. My team: Forretress? (log active but not in status—assume at 47%, switch back if needed for Spikes utility), Zapdos FNT, Lanturn ~90%, Medicham 54% CB free (Brick Break priority vs Deoxys/Lanturn), Deoxys 36% support, Charizard 100% (itemless? Salac KO'd) BD sweeper.

Post-KO, opponent is likely to switch in a healthier mon like Charizard (~94%, itemless Belly Drum set) or Medicham (~55%, possible Choice Band Brick Break user), both taking 3 layers of Spikes entry hazard (~37.5% damage).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard.\n\nRock Slide OHKO on Forretress predicted; locks Medicham into it for revenge next (strong vs Charizard/Lanturn/Deoxys, neutral but high power). Opponent post-KO switch: likely their Medicham (54%, takes Spikes ~12% dmg on entry, Brick Break revenge super vs it), or Charizard (94% itemless, EQ chunks). Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for support/absorb; position Charizard BD sweep vs remaining weakened team (their Deoxys 36%, Lanturn full but poisonable, Medicham low). Full opp team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress KO soon, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% BD set itemless, Lanturn full Volt Absorb, Deoxys 36% support. Attrit with any remaining Toxic if switch to Deoxys.\n\nForretress sacs to Rock Slide KO; Lanturn switches in to tank neutral hit safely (full HP, Leftovers). Opponent Medicham locked into Rock Slide (weak vs Lanturn). Next: Surf (STAB Water, high SpA) for ~40-50% neutral damage on Medicham (54% remaining), or Tbolt if they switch to Deoxys (neutral Electric vs Psychic). Predict opponent switch post-sac to avoid damage: likely their Charizard (~94%, itemless BD set; Surf super effective 2x as Water > Fire, Flying neutral) or Deoxys (36%; Surf neutral, but Toxic/Recover threat - use Tbolt neutral). Avoid their Lanturn switch-in if possible (Spikes 25% entry to 75%, then my Surf neutral self-match). Their Medicham post-damage prime for my reserve revenge if needed (e.g., Deoxys Toxic or my Charizard EQ super on Steel? Wait, Medicham no Steel). Overall win con: Attrit with Spikes/Leftovers, poison remaining threats with Deoxys if revives, wallbreak/sweep with Charizard BD + Salac (full HP, confirm item intact) vs weakened opp (Deoxys low, Medicham low, Zapdos FNT). Opp reserves: Charizard strong setup threat (Taunt with Deoxys if returns), their Lanturn full tank (my Surf neutral, but Volt Absorb neuters Tbolt), their Forretress/Deoxys support.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; opp switch prediction: Medicham (low, Surf chips to revenge range for my Medicham Brick Break super? Wait neutral) or Charizard (Surf 2x ~60-70% est., then my Charizard EQ revenge). Their Lanturn remains key tank threat (full, Volt Absorb—avoid Tbolt on it, use Surf neutral ~30-40%). Deoxys for Toxic on switches to poison Charizard/Lanturn for passive damage. Opp full team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress FNT, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% itemless BD set, Lanturn ~90%, Deoxys 36% support. My team: Forretress? (log active but not in status—assume at 47%, switch back if needed for Spikes utility), Zapdos FNT, Lanturn ~90%, Medicham 54% CB free (Brick Break priority vs Deoxys/Lanturn), Deoxys 36% support, Charizard 100% (itemless? Salac KO'd) BD sweeper. Win con: Maximize Spikes/poison attrition on their bulky cores (Lanturn/Deoxys), revenge with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB vs weakened remnants.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; entry hazard attrition on switch-in (3 Spikes ~37.5%). Predict opp switch to Charizard (neutral chip to ~60%, then my Charizard EQ revenge) or Medicham (chip to ~20%, setup for my Medicham Brick Break super). Their Lanturn remains top tank (full, resist Surf; avoid Tbolt). Deoxys preserved (36%) for Toxic on Charizard/Lanturn next if they switch in. Full opp status: Zapdos/Forretress FNT, Charizard ~94% itemless BD, Medicham ~55% CB?, Lanturn full, Deoxys 36%. My win con: Maximize Spikes/poison on bulks, revenge with Medicham (CB free, Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals), sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB (full, itemless but still viable post-50% Salac? wait, Salac was mine, opp's removed)."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Charizard is at 94% HP with no item, making it a high-priority target before it can set up with Belly Drum or deal significant damage. Lanturn outspeeds? No, Charizard is faster (spe ~270+ vs 170), so opponent attacks first. Fire Blast is resisted (0.5x by Water typing), dealing minimal damage (~10%). Earthquake is 2x super effective but Lanturn's bulk (HP 401, Def 152) should survive ~40-60% damage. Either way, Lanturn survives and retaliates with Surf, a STAB Water move super effective (2x on Fire typing) with high SpA (276), likely OHKOing Charizard (low SpD on setup sets). This removes a key sweeper threat, preserving my Medicham and Deoxys for revenge and support roles. No need to switch, as hazards are on opponent's side and Lanturn handles both possible moves well. Surf preferred over Thunderbolt for slightly higher base power (95 vs 90). Post-KO, expect opponent to switch to Medicham (54% -25% Spikes to ~29%) or Deoxys (36% -12.5% to ~23%), then pivot to Deoxys for Toxic to start attrition on their remaining team (Lanturn full in reserves).", "action": "surf", "scratchpad": "KO'd opp Charizard with Surf (94% into FNT).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard.\n\nRock Slide OHKO on Forretress predicted; locks Medicham into it for revenge next (strong vs Charizard/Lanturn/Deoxys, neutral but high power). Opponent post-KO switch: likely their Medicham (54%, takes Spikes ~12% dmg on entry, Brick Break revenge super vs it), or Charizard (94% itemless, EQ chunks). Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for support/absorb; position Charizard BD sweep vs remaining weakened team (their Deoxys 36%, Lanturn full but poisonable, Medicham low). Full opp team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress KO soon, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% BD set itemless, Lanturn full Volt Absorb, Deoxys 36% support. Attrit with any remaining Toxic if switch to Deoxys.\n\nForretress sacs to Rock Slide KO; Lanturn switches in to tank neutral hit safely (full HP, Leftovers). Opponent Medicham locked into Rock Slide (weak vs Lanturn). Next: Surf (STAB Water, high SpA) for ~40-50% neutral damage on Medicham (54% remaining), or Tbolt if they switch to Deoxys (neutral Electric vs Psychic). Predict opponent switch post-sac to avoid damage: likely their Charizard (~94%, itemless BD set; Surf super effective 2x as Water > Fire, Flying neutral) or Deoxys (36%; Surf neutral, but Toxic/Recover threat - use Tbolt neutral). Avoid their Lanturn switch-in if possible (Spikes 25% entry to 75%, then my Surf neutral self-match). Their Medicham post-damage prime for my reserve revenge if needed (e.g., Deoxys Toxic or my Charizard EQ super on Steel? Wait, Medicham no Steel). Overall win con: Attrit with Spikes/Leftovers, poison remaining threats with Deoxys if revives, wallbreak/sweep with Charizard BD + Salac (full HP, confirm item intact) vs weakened opp (Deoxys low, Medicham low, Zapdos FNT). Opp reserves: Charizard strong setup threat (Taunt with Deoxys if returns), their Lanturn full tank (my Surf neutral, but Volt Absorb neuters Tbolt), their Forretress/Deoxys support.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; opp switch prediction: Medicham (low, Surf chips to revenge range for my Medicham Brick Break super? Wait neutral) or Charizard (Surf 2x ~60-70% est., then my Charizard EQ revenge). Their Lanturn remains key tank threat (full, Volt Absorb—avoid Tbolt on it, use Surf neutral ~30-40%). Deoxys for Toxic on switches to poison Charizard/Lanturn for passive damage. Opp full team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress FNT, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% itemless BD set, Lanturn ~90%, Deoxys 36% support. My team: Forretress? (log active but not in status—assume at 47%, switch back if needed for Spikes utility), Zapdos FNT, Lanturn ~90%, Medicham 54% CB free (Brick Break priority vs Deoxys/Lanturn), Deoxys 36% support, Charizard 100% (itemless? Salac KO'd) BD sweeper. Win con: Maximize Spikes/poison attrition on their bulky cores (Lanturn/Deoxys), revenge with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB vs weakened remnants.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; entry hazard attrition on switch-in (3 Spikes ~37.5%). Predict opp switch to Charizard (neutral chip to ~60%, then my Charizard EQ revenge) or Medicham (chip to ~20%, setup for my Medicham Brick Break super). Their Lanturn remains top tank (full, resist Surf; avoid Tbolt). Deoxys preserved (36%) for Toxic on Charizard/Lanturn next if they switch in. Full opp status: Zapdos/Forretress FNT, Charizard ~94% itemless BD, Medicham ~55% CB?, Lanturn full, Deoxys 36%. My win con: Maximize Spikes/poison on bulks, revenge with Medicham (CB free, Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals), sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB (full, itemless but still viable post-50% Salac? wait, Salac was mine, opp's removed).\n\nKO'd opp Charizard with Surf (94% into FNT). Predict switch to Medicham (~29% post-Spikes, low revenge threat - my Medicham can Shadow Ball neutral but better reserve for Lanturn/Deoxys); or Deoxys (~23% post-Spikes, prime Toxic target). Next: Switch to Deoxys for Toxic on incoming to poison bulks (Lanturn/Deoxys/Medicham) for passive damage. If Medicham in, Deoxys Taunt to deny Zen Headbutt/revival if any. Opp remaining: Medicham 54%, Deoxys 36%, Lanturn 100% (Volt Absorb tank) - prioritize poison on Lanturn if switches back. My Medicham CB free (Shadow Ball vs Deoxys Psychic super, Brick Break neutral vs Lanturn); position for revenge kills. Deoxys low (36%) but Recover/Taunt viable. Charizard full (100%, Salac intact per status) for late Belly Drum + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs poisoned/Spiked remnants (EQ super on opp Deoxys/Lanturn, neutral Medicham).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard.\n\nRock Slide OHKO on Forretress predicted; locks Medicham into it for revenge next (strong vs Charizard/Lanturn/Deoxys, neutral but high power). Opponent post-KO switch: likely their Medicham (54%, takes Spikes ~12% dmg on entry, Brick Break revenge super vs it), or Charizard (94% itemless, EQ chunks). Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for support/absorb; position Charizard BD sweep vs remaining weakened team (their Deoxys 36%, Lanturn full but poisonable, Medicham low). Full opp team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress KO soon, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% BD set itemless, Lanturn full Volt Absorb, Deoxys 36% support. Attrit with any remaining Toxic if switch to Deoxys.\n\nForretress sacs to Rock Slide KO; Lanturn switches in to tank neutral hit safely (full HP, Leftovers). Opponent Medicham locked into Rock Slide (weak vs Lanturn). Next: Surf (STAB Water, high SpA) for ~40-50% neutral damage on Medicham (54% remaining), or Tbolt if they switch to Deoxys (neutral Electric vs Psychic). Predict opponent switch post-sac to avoid damage: likely their Charizard (~94%, itemless BD set; Surf super effective 2x as Water > Fire, Flying neutral) or Deoxys (36%; Surf neutral, but Toxic/Recover threat - use Tbolt neutral). Avoid their Lanturn switch-in if possible (Spikes 25% entry to 75%, then my Surf neutral self-match). Their Medicham post-damage prime for my reserve revenge if needed (e.g., Deoxys Toxic or my Charizard EQ super on Steel? Wait, Medicham no Steel). Overall win con: Attrit with Spikes/Leftovers, poison remaining threats with Deoxys if revives, wallbreak/sweep with Charizard BD + Salac (full HP, confirm item intact) vs weakened opp (Deoxys low, Medicham low, Zapdos FNT). Opp reserves: Charizard strong setup threat (Taunt with Deoxys if returns), their Lanturn full tank (my Surf neutral, but Volt Absorb neuters Tbolt), their Forretress/Deoxys support.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; opp switch prediction: Medicham (low, Surf chips to revenge range for my Medicham Brick Break super? Wait neutral) or Charizard (Surf 2x ~60-70% est., then my Charizard EQ revenge). Their Lanturn remains key tank threat (full, Volt Absorb—avoid Tbolt on it, use Surf neutral ~30-40%). Deoxys for Toxic on switches to poison Charizard/Lanturn for passive damage. Opp full team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress FNT, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% itemless BD set, Lanturn ~90%, Deoxys 36% support. My team: Forretress? (log active but not in status—assume at 47%, switch back if needed for Spikes utility), Zapdos FNT, Lanturn ~90%, Medicham 54% CB free (Brick Break priority vs Deoxys/Lanturn), Deoxys 36% support, Charizard 100% (itemless? Salac KO'd) BD sweeper. Win con: Maximize Spikes/poison attrition on their bulky cores (Lanturn/Deoxys), revenge with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB vs weakened remnants.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; entry hazard attrition on switch-in (3 Spikes ~37.5%). Predict opp switch to Charizard (neutral chip to ~60%, then my Charizard EQ revenge) or Medicham (chip to ~20%, setup for my Medicham Brick Break super). Their Lanturn remains top tank (full, resist Surf; avoid Tbolt). Deoxys preserved (36%) for Toxic on Charizard/Lanturn next if they switch in. Full opp status: Zapdos/Forretress FNT, Charizard ~94% itemless BD, Medicham ~55% CB?, Lanturn full, Deoxys 36%. My win con: Maximize Spikes/poison on bulks, revenge with Medicham (CB free, Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals), sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB (full, itemless but still viable post-50% Salac? wait, Salac was mine, opp's removed).\n\nKO'd opp Charizard with Surf (94% into FNT). Predict switch to Medicham (~29% post-Spikes, low revenge threat - my Medicham can Shadow Ball neutral but better reserve for Lanturn/Deoxys); or Deoxys (~23% post-Spikes, prime Toxic target). Next: Switch to Deoxys for Toxic on incoming to poison bulks (Lanturn/Deoxys/Medicham) for passive damage. If Medicham in, Deoxys Taunt to deny Zen Headbutt/revival if any. Opp remaining: Medicham 54%, Deoxys 36%, Lanturn 100% (Volt Absorb tank) - prioritize poison on Lanturn if switches back. My Medicham CB free (Shadow Ball vs Deoxys Psychic super, Brick Break neutral vs Lanturn); position for revenge kills. Deoxys low (36%) but Recover/Taunt viable. Charizard full (100%, Salac intact per status) for late Belly Drum + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs poisoned/Spiked remnants (EQ super on opp Deoxys/Lanturn, neutral Medicham). Overall: Attrition via Toxic/Spikes/LO, wallbreak with Medicham, setup sweep Charizard.\n\nKO Metagross with Medicham CB Brick Break; lock-in enables revenge on opp Medicham (2x) or chip opp Lanturn (neutral). Post-Spikes, opp options crippled: Lanturn ~50%, Medicham ~17%. Next: If opp Medicham switches in, OHKO; if Lanturn, chip then switch to Deoxys Toxic/ to Charizard EQ (super on Water).

Once in, Charizard can immediately use Belly Drum to halve its HP and boost Attack to +6, activating Salac Berry for a Speed boost, positioning it to sweep the opponent's remaining weakened team (Medicham at low HP, Lanturn chipped, Deoxys low).

After this, Medicham locked to Brick Break; plan to sac if needed post-KO for revenge kills. Watch for opponent's next switch-in: prepare Lanturn for waters/grounds, Deoxys for support vs setup. Long-term: Use Charizard Belly Drum late-game sweep with Salac; Medicham as wallbreaker.\n\nSwitched Deoxys in vs opp Charizard to Taunt/setup denial. Medicham at 54% preserved for revenge (locked? confirm if first move). Opp Charizard moves: Earthquake + likely Fire Blast/Aerial Ace/Belly Drum. If Deoxys tanks, follow with Taunt; if switched, pressure with Toxic/Knock Off. Lanturn vs Ground threats; Charizard late sweep preserved.\n\nDeoxys Taunted opponent's Charizard: confirms no setup this turn; expect EQ or switch-out. If they switch, predict common Ubers like Gengar/Kyogre and prep Toxic/Knock Off. Medicham preserved at 54% for revenge on weakened foes (not locked, first move unused). Monitor opponent's Charizard item post-Knock Off if opp. Lanturn ready for Electric coverage vs Waters/Flyers. Long-term: Position Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep after walls are broken.\n\nOpponent's Charizard Taunted (1 turn left?), moves: EQ, Fire Blast (missed once); suspect Belly Drum set with Salac? Toxic applied to poison it, expect switch or attack. Deoxys healthy, follow with Recover if pressured or Knock Off on switch-ins. Medicham unpursued (no moves used, Choice Band free); sac if needed for revenge vs weakened foes. Lanturn untouched, prep vs Waters/Grounds. Long-term: Poison key threats, position Charizard for Belly Drum sweep after attrition.\n\nTaunted opp Charizard again to deny Belly Drum/setup. If they switch, prep Toxic/Knock Off on likely threats (e.g., Gengar, Kyogre). Medicham free for Brick Break revenge kills. Preserve Charizard for late Belly Drum + Salac sweep. Lanturn for absorbing Electric/Ground weaknesses.\n\nOpponent's Forretress: Taunted spiker/sacrificial, predict Explosion this turn to sac after denied setup. Deoxys will tank and Recover next if low. Revealed opp team: Charizard (likely Belly Drum Salac set, Taunt-locked earlier but recovered), Medicham (took EQ to 55%, possible revenge with Brick Break), Deoxys-Speed (support with Taunt/Toxic, LO), unknown 4th (prep Toxic/Knock Off on switch). Medicham Choice Band free (no moves used), preserve at 55% for wallbreaking. Charizard untouched for late Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn full for Water/Ground control.\n\nCurrent matchup: Deoxys vs. opp Charizard (full HP, suspected Belly Drum + Salac set w/ EQ, Fire Blast, Double Edge). Taunted to deny setup; predict EQ this turn (neutral damage, ~20-30% est., Recover LO covers). Next: Toxic to poison if stays, or Knock Off on predicted switch (e.g., if they sac Forretress again or bring Water/Ghost). Opp revealed: Charizard, Forretress (Taunt-locked last time, likely Explosion bait). My Medicham at 55% untouched moves (CB free), prime revenge killer vs. steels/darks. Preserve my Charizard (full, Salac) for post-attrition Belly Drum sweep. Lanturn untouched for absorbing Waters/Electrics/Grounds. Watch for opp's third mon: likely bulky Water (Kyogre?) or Ghost (Gengar?) - Toxic priority.\n\nOpp Charizard likely Belly Drum Salac set; Knock Off removes Berry to deny speed boost. Expect EQ retaliation (~30-40% dmg est.); Deoxys tanks and recovers next if low. If switch, Knock Off still pressures (e.g., removes LO/Lum on Kyogre/Gengar). Medicham CB free at 55% for revenge kills post-KO. Opp revealed: Charizard (setup threat), Forretress (sac/spiker, Taunt-locked prev), Medicham (took prior EQ). Unknown 4th likely bulky (Kyogre/Gengar?) - Toxic next. Position my Charizard for late BD + Salac sweep after poisoning attrition.\n\nSalac removed from opp Charizard: no speed boost on 50% after BD. Taunt denies setup; expect EQ/Fire Blast retaliation (~30-40% est. dmg). Next turn: Toxic to poison if remains (start attrition), or switch prediction with Knock Off (target bulky items like Lum on Kyogre). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, 94%), Forretress (likely Rapid Spin/Explosion, full? from switch). Unknown two: Ubers staples (Kyogre for rain, Gengar for spinblock, Groudon for sun) - prioritize Toxic on switch-ins. My Medicham 55% CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels). Charizard full Salac for post-setup sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs potential Kyogre, Thunderbolt coverage.\n\nOpp revealed Zapdos (likely special attacker w/ Tbolt, HP Ice/Draco; Pressure ability) - Toxic applied for attrition. Expect neutral Electric damage ~25%, Recover next if below 70%. Taunt ends this turn. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless 94%), Medicham (55%?), Forretress (sac/spikes), Zapdos (full, Taunted). Unknown 1: Likely Kyogre/Groudon/Gengar - Toxic priority on switch-ins. Medicham CB free (Brick Break vs Ghosts/Darks), revenge post-poisons. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep. Lanturn full for Water absorb vs Kyogre, Tbolt coverage vs Waters/Flyers.\n\nSwitched to Lanturn vs Zapdos Electric threat; absorbs Tbolt and heals ~100 HP (to full+). Deoxys preserved at 36% for Taunt/Toxic support later. Zapdos set: special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, likely HP Ice/Draco/Roost/Thunder Wave); threaten with Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn (neutral but high SpA). Prioritize Toxic on switches (e.g., opp unknown mon, Charizard if returns). Opp revealed: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%, poison it), Medicham (~55%, CB Brick Break?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full). Medicham CB free for Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels. Charizard full Salac for late BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep post-attrition.\n\nOpp revealed Lanturn (full, Volt Absorb LO, Water/Electric bulky special tank; moves likely Tbolt/Surf/Ice Beam/Thunder Wave). Zapdos full, likely special attacker (Tbolt confirmed, possible HP Ice/Draco/Roost); Surf chunks it super effectively. Opp team: Charizard (BD set, itemless ~94%), Medicham (~55%, CB?), Forretress (sac/spiker), Zapdos (full), Lanturn (full); unknown 0, 4 left. Prioritize Surf/Tbolt from Lanturn to pressure Zapdos, then switch if needed. Medicham CB free (Brick Break revenge vs Ghosts/Darks/Steels if opp has any). Deoxys low (36%) for Taunt/Toxic support later. Charizard full Salac? (status says yes, but log knocked off earlier - confirm) for post-attrition BD + Double Edge/FB/EQ sweep.\n\nOpp Zapdos ~63%, special attacker (Tbolt resisted/heals, HP ~18% neutral chip). Surf near-KO likely. My Charizard itemless (Salac KO'd), but still prime Belly Drum setup late vs weakened team (EQ coverage vs opp Deoxys/Lanturn). Medicham 54% CB free (prefer Brick Break vs potential Ghosts/Darks, but Rock Slide vs Flying like Zapdos). Deoxys 36% preserve for Taunt/Toxic on switches (opp has no more unknowns: full revealed - Deoxys support, Lanturn tank, Zapdos attacker, Charizard setup, Forretress sac, ? sixth not seen). Post-Zapdos KO, predict opp switch to Charizard (Tbolt weak) or Lanturn (Surf chunks); Toxic priority with Deoxys. Overall: Attrit with poison/support, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + attacks.\n\nKO'd opp Zapdos with Tbolt; their team now: Charizard (~94%, BD set itemless, poison if possible), Medicham (~55%, likely CB Brick Break), Forretress (sac/spiker full?), Lanturn (74%, Volt Absorb tank), Deoxys (low earlier, support Taunt/Toxic/Recover), unknown sixth (possible Gengar/Kyogre/Groudon). Post-KO switch prediction: Charizard (neutral to Tbolt/Surf, but fears Medicham Brick Break) or Lanturn (resists Electric, chunks to Surf); respond with Deoxys Toxic for attrition or Medicham revenge (Brick Break super on Charizard Psychic/Dark if any). My Zapdos preserved at 27% for special pressure later; Medicham CB free (prioritize Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals, Rock Slide vs Flyers). Attrit poisons, wallbreak with Medicham, setup Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep.\n\nOpp Forretress likely Explosion sac post-Zapdos KO; switched to Medicham (54%, CB free) to tank and revenge next (prioritize Brick Break vs Charizard/Deoxys/Lanturn; neutral but high power). If no sac, Brick Break chunks Forretress. Lanturn preserved full for Waters/Electrics (absorb opp Lanturn Tbolt? Opp Lanturn SpA high). Opp team full revealed? Wait, log shows opp Deoxys/Lanturn/Zapdos FNT/Forretress/Charizard/Medicham - yes 6. Their Medicham ~55% likely CB Brick Break revenge threat; target with Surf/Toxic later. Deoxys 36% for Taunt/Toxic on switches. Charizard full itemless? (Salac KO'd earlier) for post-attrition BD + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs weakened (e.g., their Deoxys/Lanturn). Attrit remaining: Poison their Charizard/Lanturn if possible, wallbreak with Medicham, sweep Charizard.\n\nRock Slide OHKO on Forretress predicted; locks Medicham into it for revenge next (strong vs Charizard/Lanturn/Deoxys, neutral but high power). Opponent post-KO switch: likely their Medicham (54%, takes Spikes ~12% dmg on entry, Brick Break revenge super vs it), or Charizard (94% itemless, EQ chunks). Preserve Deoxys/Lanturn for support/absorb; position Charizard BD sweep vs remaining weakened team (their Deoxys 36%, Lanturn full but poisonable, Medicham low). Full opp team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress KO soon, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% BD set itemless, Lanturn full Volt Absorb, Deoxys 36% support. Attrit with any remaining Toxic if switch to Deoxys.\n\nForretress sacs to Rock Slide KO; Lanturn switches in to tank neutral hit safely (full HP, Leftovers). Opponent Medicham locked into Rock Slide (weak vs Lanturn). Next: Surf (STAB Water, high SpA) for ~40-50% neutral damage on Medicham (54% remaining), or Tbolt if they switch to Deoxys (neutral Electric vs Psychic). Predict opponent switch post-sac to avoid damage: likely their Charizard (~94%, itemless BD set; Surf super effective 2x as Water > Fire, Flying neutral) or Deoxys (36%; Surf neutral, but Toxic/Recover threat - use Tbolt neutral). Avoid their Lanturn switch-in if possible (Spikes 25% entry to 75%, then my Surf neutral self-match). Their Medicham post-damage prime for my reserve revenge if needed (e.g., Deoxys Toxic or my Charizard EQ super on Steel? Wait, Medicham no Steel). Overall win con: Attrit with Spikes/Leftovers, poison remaining threats with Deoxys if revives, wallbreak/sweep with Charizard BD + Salac (full HP, confirm item intact) vs weakened opp (Deoxys low, Medicham low, Zapdos FNT). Opp reserves: Charizard strong setup threat (Taunt with Deoxys if returns), their Lanturn full tank (my Surf neutral, but Volt Absorb neuters Tbolt), their Forretress/Deoxys support.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; opp switch prediction: Medicham (low, Surf chips to revenge range for my Medicham Brick Break super? Wait neutral) or Charizard (Surf 2x ~60-70% est., then my Charizard EQ revenge). Their Lanturn remains key tank threat (full, Volt Absorb—avoid Tbolt on it, use Surf neutral ~30-40%). Deoxys for Toxic on switches to poison Charizard/Lanturn for passive damage. Opp full team status: Zapdos FNT, Forretress FNT, Medicham 54%, Charizard ~94% itemless BD set, Lanturn ~90%, Deoxys 36% support. My team: Forretress? (log active but not in status—assume at 47%, switch back if needed for Spikes utility), Zapdos FNT, Lanturn ~90%, Medicham 54% CB free (Brick Break priority vs Deoxys/Lanturn), Deoxys 36% support, Charizard 100% (itemless? Salac KO'd) BD sweeper. Win con: Maximize Spikes/poison attrition on their bulky cores (Lanturn/Deoxys), revenge with Medicham, sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB vs weakened remnants.\n\nKO'd opp Forretress with Surf; entry hazard attrition on switch-in (3 Spikes ~37.5%). Predict opp switch to Charizard (neutral chip to ~60%, then my Charizard EQ revenge) or Medicham (chip to ~20%, setup for my Medicham Brick Break super). Their Lanturn remains top tank (full, resist Surf; avoid Tbolt). Deoxys preserved (36%) for Toxic on Charizard/Lanturn next if they switch in. Full opp status: Zapdos/Forretress FNT, Charizard ~94% itemless BD, Medicham ~55% CB?, Lanturn full, Deoxys 36%. My win con: Maximize Spikes/poison on bulks, revenge with Medicham (CB free, Brick Break vs Psychics/Normals), sweep with Charizard BD + EQ/DE/FB (full, itemless but still viable post-50% Salac? wait, Salac was mine, opp's removed).\n\nKO'd opp Charizard with Surf (94% into FNT). Predict switch to Medicham (~29% post-Spikes, low revenge threat - my Medicham can Shadow Ball neutral but better reserve for Lanturn/Deoxys); or Deoxys (~23% post-Spikes, prime Toxic target). Next: Switch to Deoxys for Toxic on incoming to poison bulks (Lanturn/Deoxys/Medicham) for passive damage. If Medicham in, Deoxys Taunt to deny Zen Headbutt/revival if any. Opp remaining: Medicham 54%, Deoxys 36%, Lanturn 100% (Volt Absorb tank) - prioritize poison on Lanturn if switches back. My Medicham CB free (Shadow Ball vs Deoxys Psychic super, Brick Break neutral vs Lanturn); position for revenge kills. Deoxys low (36%) but Recover/Taunt viable. Charizard full (100%, Salac intact per status) for late Belly Drum + EQ/DE/FB sweep vs poisoned/Spiked remnants (EQ super on opp Deoxys/Lanturn, neutral Medicham). Overall: Attrition via Toxic/Spikes/LO, wallbreak with Medicham, setup sweep Charizard.\n\nKO Metagross with Medicham CB Brick Break; lock-in enables revenge on opp Medicham (2x) or chip opp Lanturn (neutral). Post-Spikes, opp options crippled: Lanturn ~50%, Medicham ~17%. Next: If opp Medicham switches in, OHKO; if Lanturn, chip then switch to Deoxys Toxic/ to Charizard EQ (super on Water).

Opp no major threats left post-attrition.\n\nSwitched to Charizard vs full HP Metagross (EQ threat, but immune); immediate Belly Drum + Fire Blast super effective OHKO predicted, then EQ coverage vs opp Lanturn/Deoxys (super effective), DE/Brick Break neutral vs Medicham low.

As a special attacker with high base Special Attack (150), Kyogre poses a major threat to Heracross, who takes neutral damage from Water and has moderate Special Defense (base 75, 226 EV'd). Heracross's Speed (269) is likely outpaced by a standard EV'd Kyogre (base 90, max ~280+ Speed), and even if not, Heracross cannot reliably damage Kyogre significantly before being KO'd by Water Spout (150 BP at full HP) or Hydro Pump in rain.

Metagross CB for breaking walls, Rayquaza CB for speed control/priority, Lapras as special wall/healer.\n\nCradily likely defensive wall (Recover, Toxic, Giga Drain, Rock Slide?); monitor for status moves or recovery. Megahorn should ~40-50% damage estimate (Heracross high Atk vs Cradily base 100 Def). If status incoming, Guts activates for +50% Atk boost. Opponent may switch to counter Bug/Fighting after chip.\n\nSwitched to Lapras vs Kyogre rain threat; Water Absorb heals on Water moves. Kyogre probable moveset: Water Spout/Hydro Pump (absorb), Thunder (super on Lapras, ~60-80% damage est. with rain acc), Ice Beam/Calm Mind (neutral/manageable). Opponent team: Wynaut/Cradily fainted (sacrificial leads), Kyogre Drizzle unknown item (likely Leftovers/Scarf). Preserve Heracross for Guts activation later. Metagross for Steel coverage, Rayquaza priority sweeper. Long-term: Rain favors Kyogre, but Lapras Tbolt pressures; aim to remove Kyogre early to deny weather control.\n\nKyogre moves: Surf confirmed, predict Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind. Damage est: Tbolt ~35% to Kyogre; Kyogre Thunder ~50-60% to Lapras. If Lapras low post-turn, Rest next. Switch to Metagross if Kyogre sets up. Heracross save for Guts vs weakened threats. Rayquaza priority for late-game cleanup. Opponent last mon unknown, likely counter to rain (e.g., Groudon?); aim to faint Kyogre soon to end Drizzle.\n\nSwitched to Metagross vs Kyogre; expect Thunder (~25% damage est., tankable). Next turn: CB Meteor Mash for ~40-50% to Kyogre (neutral physical Steel). If Kyogre switches (e.g., to Ground-type counter), EQ coverage. Preserve Heracross/Rayquaza for post-Kyogre threats; unknown opp mon likely sun setter (Groudon?) or stall. Aim to KO Kyogre this/next turn to flip weather advantage.\n\nSacrificed Metagross via Explosion to KO Kyogre, ending rain/Drizzle advantage. Next: Bring in Rayquaza for CB Earthquake/Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Heracross for Megahorn/Focus Punch if Guts procs. Opponent's last mon unknown—predict Groudon (sun setter) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza's Air Lock can deny weather if it revives sun. Lapras low, preserve for Water Absorb if needed. Post-rain, favor physical attackers over special watery threats.\n\nSwitched to Heracross safely vs Kyogre; tank special hit and retaliate with Megahorn or SD based on opponent's move. Kyogre ~84% HP, aim to chunk/KO next turn. Opponent's last mon unknown—likely Groudon (sun) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza Air Lock key to deny weather recovery. Preserve low Lapras for potential Water Absorb utility. Post-Kyogre, Rayquaza Extremespeed for priority sweeps.\n\nSwitched Rayquaza in to tank Thunder (~41% dmg, to 59%) and EQ OHKO Kyogre next turn (>100% dmg). Locked into EQ vs last mon (Groudon immune, 0 dmg); Ray takes 1-2 neutral hits (~50-60% each), likely faints after 1-2 turns but allows switch to full HP Heracross for Megahorn (~55% neutral chip/possible KO if weakened). If Groudon has super effective move (Rock ~56%, Electric ~60%), may OHKO Ray at 59%—risk accepted to preserve Heracross. Lapras 28% for Ice Beam super (~54%) if needed.

Rayquaza Speed 226 likely outspeeds Kyogre's base 90 (est. ~250-300 max without boosts). Opponent may switch to last mon (predict Groudon, immune to EQ as Ground-type), locking us into EQ, but worth the risk to remove Kyogre and end Drizzle advantage.

Track revealed opponent Pokémon/items/abilities. Heracross healthy, preserve for revenge killing or setup if safe. Metagross CB for breaking walls, Rayquaza CB for speed control/priority, Lapras as special wall/healer.\n\nCradily likely defensive wall (Recover, Toxic, Giga Drain, Rock Slide?); monitor for status moves or recovery. Megahorn should ~40-50% damage estimate (Heracross high Atk vs Cradily base 100 Def). If status incoming, Guts activates for +50% Atk boost. Opponent may switch to counter Bug/Fighting after chip.\n\nSwitched to Lapras vs Kyogre rain threat; Water Absorb heals on Water moves. Kyogre probable moveset: Water Spout/Hydro Pump (absorb), Thunder (super on Lapras, ~60-80% damage est. with rain acc), Ice Beam/Calm Mind (neutral/manageable). Opponent team: Wynaut/Cradily fainted (sacrificial leads), Kyogre Drizzle unknown item (likely Leftovers/Scarf). Preserve Heracross for Guts activation later. Metagross for Steel coverage, Rayquaza priority sweeper. Long-term: Rain favors Kyogre, but Lapras Tbolt pressures; aim to remove Kyogre early to deny weather control.\n\nKyogre moves: Surf confirmed, predict Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind. Damage est: Tbolt ~35% to Kyogre; Kyogre Thunder ~50-60% to Lapras. If Lapras low post-turn, Rest next. Switch to Metagross if Kyogre sets up. Heracross save for Guts vs weakened threats. Rayquaza priority for late-game cleanup. Opponent last mon unknown, likely counter to rain (e.g., Groudon?); aim to faint Kyogre soon to end Drizzle.\n\nSwitched to Metagross vs Kyogre; expect Thunder (~25% damage est., tankable). Next turn: CB Meteor Mash for ~40-50% to Kyogre (neutral physical Steel). If Kyogre switches (e.g., to Ground-type counter), EQ coverage. Preserve Heracross/Rayquaza for post-Kyogre threats; unknown opp mon likely sun setter (Groudon?) or stall. Aim to KO Kyogre this/next turn to flip weather advantage.\n\nSacrificed Metagross via Explosion to KO Kyogre, ending rain/Drizzle advantage. Next: Bring in Rayquaza for CB Earthquake/Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Heracross for Megahorn/Focus Punch if Guts procs. Opponent's last mon unknown—predict Groudon (sun setter) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza's Air Lock can deny weather if it revives sun. Lapras low, preserve for Water Absorb if needed. Post-rain, favor physical attackers over special watery threats.\n\nSwitched to Heracross safely vs Kyogre; tank special hit and retaliate with Megahorn or SD based on opponent's move. Kyogre ~84% HP, aim to chunk/KO next turn. Opponent's last mon unknown—likely Groudon (sun) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza Air Lock key to deny weather recovery. Preserve low Lapras for potential Water Absorb utility. Post-Kyogre, Rayquaza Extremespeed for priority sweeps.\n\nSwitched Rayquaza in to tank Thunder (~41% dmg, to 59%) and EQ OHKO Kyogre next turn (>100% dmg). Locked into EQ vs last mon (Groudon immune, 0 dmg); Ray takes 1-2 neutral hits (~50-60% each), likely faints after 1-2 turns but allows switch to full HP Heracross for Megahorn (~55% neutral chip/possible KO if weakened). If Groudon has super effective move (Rock ~56%, Electric ~60%), may OHKO Ray at 59%—risk accepted to preserve Heracross. Lapras 28% for Ice Beam super (~54%) if needed. Opponent last mon likely Groudon (sun setter) or Snorlax (EQ neutral chunk ~80%+ possible); monitor speed tie Heracross (269 spe) vs Groudon (~280 max). Prioritize removing Kyogre to end rain.\n\nRayquaza CB EQ on Kyogre for KO; if opp switches (likely Groudon), locked into EQ (neutral/immune bad vs non-Ground). Post-KO/switch: Heracross Megahorn chunks Groudon (~55% est., then Focus Punch if low). Opp last mon: Groudon probable (sun to counter rain loss). Ray Extreme Speed for cleanup if survives. Monitor for Stone Edge/EQ from Groudon (OHKO risk to Ray). Win con: Remove Kyogre, deny weather, sweep with Ray/Heracross priority/physical pressure.\n\nKO'd Kyogre with EQ, ending Drizzle/rain. Opponent's last mon incoming—strong prediction for Groudon (sun setter, immune to EQ) or Snorlax (EQ chunks ~70-80%). Rayquaza locked into EQ for next turn: if Groudon, switch to Heracross (Megahorn ~50-60% neutral, then SD/Focus Punch) or Lapras (Ice Beam super ~70% if Water Absorb not needed). Preserve Heracross at full for late-game sweep with Guts if status procs. Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority for cleanup if survives hits. Win con: Pressure last mon with physical coverage, use Air Lock to deny potential weather revival.\n\nOpponent's last mon: Deoxys-Defense (Pressure, unknown item), tanky special wall but OHKO'd by locked EQ. No remaining threats; victory secured. Prior prediction (Groudon/Snorlax) incorrect—opponent lacked weather counter, focused on stall/sac leads."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Rayquaza is locked into Earthquake, which will OHKO Deoxys-Defense at 57% HP given its massive Attack with Choice Band and neutral matchup against Deoxys's Defense form. Deoxys will then use Seismic Toss for fixed 100 damage, fainting our Rayquaza at 98 HP. However, with all opponent Pokémon fainted after this (Wynaut, Cradily, Kyogre, and Deoxys), we secure victory.

Track revealed opponent Pokémon/items/abilities. Heracross healthy, preserve for revenge killing or setup if safe. Metagross CB for breaking walls, Rayquaza CB for speed control/priority, Lapras as special wall/healer.\n\nCradily likely defensive wall (Recover, Toxic, Giga Drain, Rock Slide?); monitor for status moves or recovery. Megahorn should ~40-50% damage estimate (Heracross high Atk vs Cradily base 100 Def). If status incoming, Guts activates for +50% Atk boost. Opponent may switch to counter Bug/Fighting after chip.\n\nSwitched to Lapras vs Kyogre rain threat; Water Absorb heals on Water moves. Kyogre probable moveset: Water Spout/Hydro Pump (absorb), Thunder (super on Lapras, ~60-80% damage est. with rain acc), Ice Beam/Calm Mind (neutral/manageable). Opponent team: Wynaut/Cradily fainted (sacrificial leads), Kyogre Drizzle unknown item (likely Leftovers/Scarf). Preserve Heracross for Guts activation later. Metagross for Steel coverage, Rayquaza priority sweeper. Long-term: Rain favors Kyogre, but Lapras Tbolt pressures; aim to remove Kyogre early to deny weather control.\n\nKyogre moves: Surf confirmed, predict Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind. Damage est: Tbolt ~35% to Kyogre; Kyogre Thunder ~50-60% to Lapras. If Lapras low post-turn, Rest next. Switch to Metagross if Kyogre sets up. Heracross save for Guts vs weakened threats. Rayquaza priority for late-game cleanup. Opponent last mon unknown, likely counter to rain (e.g., Groudon?); aim to faint Kyogre soon to end Drizzle.\n\nSwitched to Metagross vs Kyogre; expect Thunder (~25% damage est., tankable). Next turn: CB Meteor Mash for ~40-50% to Kyogre (neutral physical Steel). If Kyogre switches (e.g., to Ground-type counter), EQ coverage. Preserve Heracross/Rayquaza for post-Kyogre threats; unknown opp mon likely sun setter (Groudon?) or stall. Aim to KO Kyogre this/next turn to flip weather advantage.\n\nSacrificed Metagross via Explosion to KO Kyogre, ending rain/Drizzle advantage. Next: Bring in Rayquaza for CB Earthquake/Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Heracross for Megahorn/Focus Punch if Guts procs. Opponent's last mon unknown—predict Groudon (sun setter) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza's Air Lock can deny weather if it revives sun. Lapras low, preserve for Water Absorb if needed. Post-rain, favor physical attackers over special watery threats.\n\nSwitched to Heracross safely vs Kyogre; tank special hit and retaliate with Megahorn or SD based on opponent's move. Kyogre ~84% HP, aim to chunk/KO next turn. Opponent's last mon unknown—likely Groudon (sun) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza Air Lock key to deny weather recovery. Preserve low Lapras for potential Water Absorb utility. Post-Kyogre, Rayquaza Extremespeed for priority sweeps.\n\nSwitched Rayquaza in to tank Thunder (~41% dmg, to 59%) and EQ OHKO Kyogre next turn (>100% dmg). Locked into EQ vs last mon (Groudon immune, 0 dmg); Ray takes 1-2 neutral hits (~50-60% each), likely faints after 1-2 turns but allows switch to full HP Heracross for Megahorn (~55% neutral chip/possible KO if weakened). If Groudon has super effective move (Rock ~56%, Electric ~60%), may OHKO Ray at 59%—risk accepted to preserve Heracross. Lapras 28% for Ice Beam super (~54%) if needed. Opponent last mon likely Groudon (sun setter) or Snorlax (EQ neutral chunk ~80%+ possible); monitor speed tie Heracross (269 spe) vs Groudon (~280 max). Prioritize removing Kyogre to end rain.\n\nRayquaza CB EQ on Kyogre for KO; if opp switches (likely Groudon), locked into EQ (neutral/immune bad vs non-Ground). Post-KO/switch: Heracross Megahorn chunks Groudon (~55% est., then Focus Punch if low). Opp last mon: Groudon probable (sun to counter rain loss). Ray Extreme Speed for cleanup if survives. Monitor for Stone Edge/EQ from Groudon (OHKO risk to Ray). Win con: Remove Kyogre, deny weather, sweep with Ray/Heracross priority/physical pressure.\n\nKO'd Kyogre with EQ, ending Drizzle/rain. Opponent's last mon incoming—strong prediction for Groudon (sun setter, immune to EQ) or Snorlax (EQ chunks ~70-80%). Rayquaza locked into EQ for next turn: if Groudon, switch to Heracross (Megahorn ~50-60% neutral, then SD/Focus Punch) or Lapras (Ice Beam super ~70% if Water Absorb not needed). Preserve Heracross at full for late-game sweep with Guts if status procs. Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority for cleanup if survives hits. Win con: Pressure last mon with physical coverage, use Air Lock to deny potential weather revival.\n\nOpponent's last mon: Deoxys-Defense (Pressure, unknown item), tanky special wall but OHKO'd by locked EQ.

Heracross is the optimal choice: full HP, Guts ability, and Megahorn is super effective against Deoxys (Psychic-type), with Heracross's high Attack (383) likely OHKOing Deoxys' low remaining HP and base 50 HP / high but irrelevant Def for this matchup.

Track revealed opponent Pokémon/items/abilities. Heracross healthy, preserve for revenge killing or setup if safe. Metagross CB for breaking walls, Rayquaza CB for speed control/priority, Lapras as special wall/healer.\n\nCradily likely defensive wall (Recover, Toxic, Giga Drain, Rock Slide?); monitor for status moves or recovery. Megahorn should ~40-50% damage estimate (Heracross high Atk vs Cradily base 100 Def). If status incoming, Guts activates for +50% Atk boost. Opponent may switch to counter Bug/Fighting after chip.\n\nSwitched to Lapras vs Kyogre rain threat; Water Absorb heals on Water moves. Kyogre probable moveset: Water Spout/Hydro Pump (absorb), Thunder (super on Lapras, ~60-80% damage est. with rain acc), Ice Beam/Calm Mind (neutral/manageable). Opponent team: Wynaut/Cradily fainted (sacrificial leads), Kyogre Drizzle unknown item (likely Leftovers/Scarf). Preserve Heracross for Guts activation later. Metagross for Steel coverage, Rayquaza priority sweeper. Long-term: Rain favors Kyogre, but Lapras Tbolt pressures; aim to remove Kyogre early to deny weather control.\n\nKyogre moves: Surf confirmed, predict Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind. Damage est: Tbolt ~35% to Kyogre; Kyogre Thunder ~50-60% to Lapras. If Lapras low post-turn, Rest next. Switch to Metagross if Kyogre sets up. Heracross save for Guts vs weakened threats. Rayquaza priority for late-game cleanup. Opponent last mon unknown, likely counter to rain (e.g., Groudon?); aim to faint Kyogre soon to end Drizzle.\n\nSwitched to Metagross vs Kyogre; expect Thunder (~25% damage est., tankable). Next turn: CB Meteor Mash for ~40-50% to Kyogre (neutral physical Steel). If Kyogre switches (e.g., to Ground-type counter), EQ coverage. Preserve Heracross/Rayquaza for post-Kyogre threats; unknown opp mon likely sun setter (Groudon?) or stall. Aim to KO Kyogre this/next turn to flip weather advantage.\n\nSacrificed Metagross via Explosion to KO Kyogre, ending rain/Drizzle advantage. Next: Bring in Rayquaza for CB Earthquake/Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Heracross for Megahorn/Focus Punch if Guts procs. Opponent's last mon unknown—predict Groudon (sun setter) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza's Air Lock can deny weather if it revives sun. Lapras low, preserve for Water Absorb if needed. Post-rain, favor physical attackers over special watery threats.\n\nSwitched to Heracross safely vs Kyogre; tank special hit and retaliate with Megahorn or SD based on opponent's move. Kyogre ~84% HP, aim to chunk/KO next turn. Opponent's last mon unknown—likely Groudon (sun) or stall like Snorlax; Rayquaza Air Lock key to deny weather recovery. Preserve low Lapras for potential Water Absorb utility. Post-Kyogre, Rayquaza Extremespeed for priority sweeps.\n\nSwitched Rayquaza in to tank Thunder (~41% dmg, to 59%) and EQ OHKO Kyogre next turn (>100% dmg). Locked into EQ vs last mon (Groudon immune, 0 dmg); Ray takes 1-2 neutral hits (~50-60% each), likely faints after 1-2 turns but allows switch to full HP Heracross for Megahorn (~55% neutral chip/possible KO if weakened). If Groudon has super effective move (Rock ~56%, Electric ~60%), may OHKO Ray at 59%—risk accepted to preserve Heracross. Lapras 28% for Ice Beam super (~54%) if needed. Opponent last mon likely Groudon (sun setter) or Snorlax (EQ neutral chunk ~80%+ possible); monitor speed tie Heracross (269 spe) vs Groudon (~280 max). Prioritize removing Kyogre to end rain.\n\nRayquaza CB EQ on Kyogre for KO; if opp switches (likely Groudon), locked into EQ (neutral/immune bad vs non-Ground). Post-KO/switch: Heracross Megahorn chunks Groudon (~55% est., then Focus Punch if low). Opp last mon: Groudon probable (sun to counter rain loss). Ray Extreme Speed for cleanup if survives. Monitor for Stone Edge/EQ from Groudon (OHKO risk to Ray). Win con: Remove Kyogre, deny weather, sweep with Ray/Heracross priority/physical pressure.\n\nKO'd Kyogre with EQ, ending Drizzle/rain. Opponent's last mon incoming—strong prediction for Groudon (sun setter, immune to EQ) or Snorlax (EQ chunks ~70-80%). Rayquaza locked into EQ for next turn: if Groudon, switch to Heracross (Megahorn ~50-60% neutral, then SD/Focus Punch) or Lapras (Ice Beam super ~70% if Water Absorb not needed). Preserve Heracross at full for late-game sweep with Guts if status procs. Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority for cleanup if survives hits. Win con: Pressure last mon with physical coverage, use Air Lock to deny potential weather revival.\n\nOpponent's last mon: Deoxys-Defense (Pressure, unknown item), tanky special wall but OHKO'd by locked EQ. No remaining threats; victory secured. Prior prediction (Groudon/Snorlax) incorrect—opponent lacked weather counter, focused on stall/sac leads.\n\nBattle won this turn; no further threats.\n\nRayquaza KO'd to outspeed Seismic Toss; Deoxys at 57 HP last mon. Switched Heracross for Megahorn OHKO next turn. Victory imminent—no further opponent threats.\n\nBattle won: Heracross Megahorn OHKOs final Deoxys.

Megahorn is STAB Bug super effective against Psychic-type Deoxys, and with Heracross's high Atk (383), it should OHKO the frail Deoxys-D even with its high Def. Deoxys's known moves are Seismic Toss (fixed 100 damage, but Heracross has 302 HP so survives) and Recover (which it just used last turn).

Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall vs setup, Suicune for phazing bulky waters like Kyogre.\n\nMy Jirachi to +3 SpA/SpD this turn. Opponent Jirachi: no boosts, no Leftovers (item likely Life Orb or choice).

Deoxys-D as anti-setup if needed, Suicune for waters.\n\nUsed HP Dark on opponent's Jirachi at +3 SpA. Expect heavy damage or switch; if they faint it, great momentum. Opponent's Jirachi item confirmed no LO, likely Choice or LO, locked in Psychic? Next turn, if low HP, finish with Psychic or another HP Dark. Prepare Mewtwo if they sac and bring threat like Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder). Deoxys-D for stall if needed vs setup. Suicune for bulky waters. Track opponent team: none revealed yet besides Jirachi.\n\nKO opponent's Jirachi with HP Dark. Confirmed Choice Specs Psychic likely. After faint, scout opponent's next mon; switch to Mewtwo for Groudon (Thunder), Suicune for Kyogre/Swampert. Preserve Jirachi boosts for late-game sweeping.

Team threats to watch: Snorlax stall, Kyogre rain, Groudon sun, Rayquaza setup.\n\nOpponent revealed Hitmonlee (likely offensive revenge killer, possible Choice Band/Hi Jump Kick/Mach Punch). After Psychic, if survives, expect Fighting retaliation (resisted); consider switching to Mewtwo (Thunder for Grounds) or Suicune (Calm Mind vs Waters) next if needed. Deoxys-D ready for Taunt/stall vs setup. Watch for predicted threats: Kyogre (Suicune phaze/setup), Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Seismic Toss). Jirachi +3 boosts intact for sweeping.\n\nGyarados: Intimidate confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/EQ/Thrash set (physical sweeper). Expect DD this turn for +1 Atk/Spe. Jirachi tanks resisted Waterfall/neutral EQ at +3 SpD. Post-Psychic chunk, finish with another Psychic/HP Dark or switch to Mewtwo (Thunder SE vs Water/Flying) if boosted. Suicune Roar to phaze setup Gyarados later. Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if opponent sets up elsewhere. Fainted opp: Specs Jirachi (Psychic-locked), Hitmonlee (Fighting revenge).

My Jirachi, despite +3 SpA/SpD boosts, is neutral to Water and may not survive a full-power Water Spout in rain, even moving first with Psychic (which would deal significant but likely non-lethal damage). Switching to Suicune is optimal: as a Water-type, it resists Water moves (0.5x), has high SpD (266 base stat, bulky with Leftovers), and can set up with Calm Mind, phaze with Roar to reset Kyogre's boosts, or chip with Surf in rain. This preserves Jirachi's valuable +3 boosts for late-game sweeping against other threats like potential Groudon or Snorlax, while gaining momentum against Kyogre.

Opponent's Kyogre is likely a special attacker with Water Spout/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, but full HP and Drizzle sets rain immediately. Given Suicune's defensive typing and Pressure ability, setting up with Calm Mind now boosts SpA/SpD to pressure Kyogre further while recovering via Leftovers.

Likely similar moves: CM, Psychic, maybe Iron Head/Thunderbolt. Track boosts if both set up. Team threats: Watch for opponent's Snorlax, Kyogre, Groudon. Position Mewtwo for late-game sweep after walls soften. Deoxys-D for stalling, Suicune for water absorb/phazing.\n\nMy Jirachi now at potential +2 SpA/SpD after this CM. Opponent Jirachi moves: Psychic confirmed, likely CM possible. Monitor if opponent boosts or switches; prepare Mewtwo for Psychic-weak threats like Groudon. Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall vs setup, Suicune for phazing bulky waters like Kyogre.\n\nMy Jirachi to +3 SpA/SpD this turn. Opponent Jirachi: no boosts, no Leftovers (item likely Life Orb or choice). If opponent CMs now, still behind; prepare to Psychic next if they stay in. Watch for switch to Groudon/Kyogre; Mewtwo ready for them. Deoxys-D as anti-setup if needed, Suicune for waters.\n\nUsed HP Dark on opponent's Jirachi at +3 SpA. Expect heavy damage or switch; if they faint it, great momentum. Opponent's Jirachi item confirmed no LO, likely Choice or LO, locked in Psychic? Next turn, if low HP, finish with Psychic or another HP Dark. Prepare Mewtwo if they sac and bring threat like Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder). Deoxys-D for stall if needed vs setup. Suicune for bulky waters. Track opponent team: none revealed yet besides Jirachi.\n\nKO opponent's Jirachi with HP Dark. Confirmed Choice Specs Psychic likely. After faint, scout opponent's next mon; switch to Mewtwo for Groudon (Thunder), Suicune for Kyogre/Swampert. Preserve Jirachi boosts for late-game sweeping. Deoxys-D ready for stall/taunt vs setup threats like Rayquaza. Opponent team still mostly unknown beyond Jirachi.\n\nKO'd opponent's Choice Specs Jirachi with +3 HP Dark. Momentum gained. Opponent's next mon unknown; scout and position accordingly: Mewtwo vs Grounds (Thunder), Suicune vs Waters (Calm Mind setup), Deoxys-D vs setup (Taunt/Seismic Toss). Preserve my Jirachi's +3 boosts for sweeping later. Team threats to watch: Snorlax stall, Kyogre rain, Groudon sun, Rayquaza setup.\n\nOpponent revealed Hitmonlee (likely offensive revenge killer, possible Choice Band/Hi Jump Kick/Mach Punch). After Psychic, if survives, expect Fighting retaliation (resisted); consider switching to Mewtwo (Thunder for Grounds) or Suicune (Calm Mind vs Waters) next if needed. Deoxys-D ready for Taunt/stall vs setup. Watch for predicted threats: Kyogre (Suicune phaze/setup), Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Seismic Toss). Jirachi +3 boosts intact for sweeping.\n\nGyarados: Intimidate confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/EQ/Thrash set (physical sweeper). Expect DD this turn for +1 Atk/Spe. Jirachi tanks resisted Waterfall/neutral EQ at +3 SpD. Post-Psychic chunk, finish with another Psychic/HP Dark or switch to Mewtwo (Thunder SE vs Water/Flying) if boosted. Suicune Roar to phaze setup Gyarados later. Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if opponent sets up elsewhere. Fainted opp: Specs Jirachi (Psychic-locked), Hitmonlee (Fighting revenge). Remaining threats: Likely Kyogre (Suicune setup/phaze), Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Seismic Toss/Taunt). Preserve Jirachi +3 for sweeping after walls.\n\nSwitched to Suicune vs full HP Kyogre in rain. Suicune plan: Roar to phaze if Kyogre CMs, else Calm Mind + Surf to setup and pressure (rain boosts Surf). Jirachi +3 preserved for sweeping Grounds/Psychic-weak foes like Groudon. Watch for Kyogre moves: expect Water Spout/Thunder/CM; if Thunder, Suicune neutral. Fainted opp mons confirm offensive team; remaining likely include Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss). Position Mewtwo after walls for late sweep.\n\nMy Jirachi at +2 SpA/SpD (confirmed from log: two CMs before attacking). Suicune CM turn 10 vs Kyogre: aim for +1 or more to Surf spam in rain (STAB boost) while Pressure drains PP. If Kyogre CMs, follow with Roar to phaze boosts away. Post-Kyogre, expect Groudon (switch to Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss). Fainted opp: Specs Choice Jirachi (Psychic), Hitmonlee (Fighting), Gyarados (Intimidate DD). Remaining opp likely Groudon/Snorlax/Rayquaza; track Kyogre moves (Thunder confirmed) for set prediction.\n\nSuicune fainted vs Kyogre Thunder/Water Spout. Fainted opp: Specs Choice Jirachi (Psychic), Hitmonlee (Fighting), Gyarados (Intimidate DD), now Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunder/Water Spout likely). Remaining opp: Likely Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder/CM then Ice Beam), Snorlax (switch Jirachi +2 Psychic sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss). Mewtwo switches in safely, KOs Kyogre, then assess: If Groudon in, Thunder it; if Rayquaza, switch Deoxys-D; Jirachi ready for bulky non-Water threats. Deoxys-D for stall/taunt vs setup.

Kyogre's Water Spout or Thunder would deal neutral damage to Mewtwo, but Mewtwo's high SpA (447) and bulk should allow it to survive if needed; however, securing the KO gains momentum. No need to switch, as Deoxys-D or Jirachi wouldn't handle Kyogre as well (Jirachi resists Water but weak to potential Ice Beam, Deoxys-D neutral but low offenses).

Likely similar moves: CM, Psychic, maybe Iron Head/Thunderbolt. Track boosts if both set up. Team threats: Watch for opponent's Snorlax, Kyogre, Groudon. Position Mewtwo for late-game sweep after walls soften. Deoxys-D for stalling, Suicune for water absorb/phazing.\n\nMy Jirachi now at potential +2 SpA/SpD after this CM. Opponent Jirachi moves: Psychic confirmed, likely CM possible. Monitor if opponent boosts or switches; prepare Mewtwo for Psychic-weak threats like Groudon. Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall vs setup, Suicune for phazing bulky waters like Kyogre.\n\nMy Jirachi to +3 SpA/SpD this turn. Opponent Jirachi: no boosts, no Leftovers (item likely Life Orb or choice). If opponent CMs now, still behind; prepare to Psychic next if they stay in. Watch for switch to Groudon/Kyogre; Mewtwo ready for them. Deoxys-D as anti-setup if needed, Suicune for waters.\n\nUsed HP Dark on opponent's Jirachi at +3 SpA. Expect heavy damage or switch; if they faint it, great momentum. Opponent's Jirachi item confirmed no LO, likely Choice or LO, locked in Psychic? Next turn, if low HP, finish with Psychic or another HP Dark. Prepare Mewtwo if they sac and bring threat like Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder). Deoxys-D for stall if needed vs setup. Suicune for bulky waters. Track opponent team: none revealed yet besides Jirachi.\n\nKO opponent's Jirachi with HP Dark. Confirmed Choice Specs Psychic likely. After faint, scout opponent's next mon; switch to Mewtwo for Groudon (Thunder), Suicune for Kyogre/Swampert. Preserve Jirachi boosts for late-game sweeping. Deoxys-D ready for stall/taunt vs setup threats like Rayquaza. Opponent team still mostly unknown beyond Jirachi.\n\nKO'd opponent's Choice Specs Jirachi with +3 HP Dark. Momentum gained. Opponent's next mon unknown; scout and position accordingly: Mewtwo vs Grounds (Thunder), Suicune vs Waters (Calm Mind setup), Deoxys-D vs setup (Taunt/Seismic Toss). Preserve my Jirachi's +3 boosts for sweeping later. Team threats to watch: Snorlax stall, Kyogre rain, Groudon sun, Rayquaza setup.\n\nOpponent revealed Hitmonlee (likely offensive revenge killer, possible Choice Band/Hi Jump Kick/Mach Punch). After Psychic, if survives, expect Fighting retaliation (resisted); consider switching to Mewtwo (Thunder for Grounds) or Suicune (Calm Mind vs Waters) next if needed. Deoxys-D ready for Taunt/stall vs setup. Watch for predicted threats: Kyogre (Suicune phaze/setup), Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Seismic Toss). Jirachi +3 boosts intact for sweeping.\n\nGyarados: Intimidate confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/EQ/Thrash set (physical sweeper). Expect DD this turn for +1 Atk/Spe. Jirachi tanks resisted Waterfall/neutral EQ at +3 SpD. Post-Psychic chunk, finish with another Psychic/HP Dark or switch to Mewtwo (Thunder SE vs Water/Flying) if boosted. Suicune Roar to phaze setup Gyarados later. Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if opponent sets up elsewhere. Fainted opp: Specs Jirachi (Psychic-locked), Hitmonlee (Fighting revenge). Remaining threats: Likely Kyogre (Suicune setup/phaze), Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Seismic Toss/Taunt). Preserve Jirachi +3 for sweeping after walls.\n\nSwitched to Suicune vs full HP Kyogre in rain. Suicune plan: Roar to phaze if Kyogre CMs, else Calm Mind + Surf to setup and pressure (rain boosts Surf). Jirachi +3 preserved for sweeping Grounds/Psychic-weak foes like Groudon. Watch for Kyogre moves: expect Water Spout/Thunder/CM; if Thunder, Suicune neutral. Fainted opp mons confirm offensive team; remaining likely include Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss). Position Mewtwo after walls for late sweep.\n\nMy Jirachi at +2 SpA/SpD (confirmed from log: two CMs before attacking). Suicune CM turn 10 vs Kyogre: aim for +1 or more to Surf spam in rain (STAB boost) while Pressure drains PP. If Kyogre CMs, follow with Roar to phaze boosts away. Post-Kyogre, expect Groudon (switch to Mewtwo Thunder), Snorlax (Jirachi sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss). Fainted opp: Specs Choice Jirachi (Psychic), Hitmonlee (Fighting), Gyarados (Intimidate DD). Remaining opp likely Groudon/Snorlax/Rayquaza; track Kyogre moves (Thunder confirmed) for set prediction.\n\nSuicune fainted vs Kyogre Thunder/Water Spout. Fainted opp: Specs Choice Jirachi (Psychic), Hitmonlee (Fighting), Gyarados (Intimidate DD), now Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunder/Water Spout likely). Remaining opp: Likely Groudon (Mewtwo Thunder/CM then Ice Beam), Snorlax (switch Jirachi +2 Psychic sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss). Mewtwo switches in safely, KOs Kyogre, then assess: If Groudon in, Thunder it; if Rayquaza, switch Deoxys-D; Jirachi ready for bulky non-Water threats. Deoxys-D for stall/taunt vs setup. My team: Mewtwo full active post-switch, Jirachi +2 SpA/SpD 75%, Deoxys-D full.\n\nKO Kyogre with Mewtwo Thunder. Fainted opp now: Specs Choice Jirachi (Psychic-locked), Hitmonlee (Fighting), Gyarados (Intimidate DD), Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunder/Water Spout/CM likely). Remaining opp: Likely Groudon (Mewtwo CM then Thunder/Ice Beam), Snorlax (Jirachi +1 Psychic sweep), Rayquaza (Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss). My Jirachi at +1 SpA/SpD ~75% HP, Deoxys-D full for stall/taunt.

This secures another KO, maintaining momentum after fainting their Jirachi, Hitmonlee, Gyarados, and now Kyogre. Pressure has likely drained some of Kyogre's PP already. After the KO, expect a switch, likely to Groudon (which Mewtwo can pressure with Calm Mind setups and neutral Thunder/Ice Beam switches), Snorlax (switch to boosted Jirachi for Psychic sweeps), or Rayquaza (switch to Deoxys-D for Taunt/Seismic Toss stall). No need to switch out now; Mewtwo can handle the KO safely without risking Lum Berry on status (Kyogre's known move is Thunder, which is neutral and we've tanked it before).

My Jirachi's physical Atk (212) should deal significant damage to pressure a switch or KO chunk, especially since the opponent likely invests more in special stats (evidenced by their Psychic use).

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Jirachi is at 50% HP and will be KO'd by Kyogre's Thunder this turn, as it previously dealt ~56% neutral damage. Staying in to use Psychic would chip Kyogre to ~56% but result in Jirachi fainting without gaining much advantage. Fire Punch and Hidden Power Dark are ineffective against Kyogre (resisted/neutral but low power from physical side). Calm Mind would boost stats but Jirachi still faints before sweeping. Switching preserves Jirachi for later walling. Mewtwo is the optimal switch-in: its high Speed (359) allows it to outspeed and revenge kill Kyogre with Thunder (neutral STAB in rain for 100% accuracy, massive SpA 447 likely deals 70-80%+ to Kyogre at 81% HP, securing the KO). Mewtwo survives the incoming Thunder (~59% damage estimated based on SpD comparison to Jirachi, leaving ~41% HP). Deoxys-D could tank and stall with Taunt/Seismic Toss, but Mewtwo gains more momentum by eliminating Kyogre immediately. Suicune is poor due to Thunder being super effective. Post-KO, prepare for likely Groudon switch with Mewtwo's coverage or pivot to Suicune for bulk.", "action": "mewtwo", "scratchpad": "Kyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers).

After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed.

Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination.

Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed.

If opponent switches (likely to Groudon to counter rain), it reveals their next mon, and Thunder would fail harmlessly due to Ground immunity, allowing me to adapt next turn with Ice Beam (super effective on Ground) or a switch. Staying in for Calm Mind is risky as Kyogre's Thunder could KO Mewtwo at half health. Self-destruct is wasteful.

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed. Preserve Jirachi for special walling Rayquaza/Lugia threats. Opp team reveals: special Jirachi (Psychic), physical Hitmonlee (likely Brick Break/Mach Punch), Kyogre - expect Groudon/Rayquaza/Shedinja or Wobbuffet as remaining.\n\nKyogre at 87% pre-turn; Thunder from Mewtwo (SpA 447, rain boost accuracy) est. 80-100% damage, likely KO if stays. If switch expected (Groudon probable, immune to Elec but weak to Ice), reveals team; pivot to Ice Beam/Suicune next vs Drought/Fire. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon/Rayquaza/setup mon. Mewtwo post-KO setup with CM if safe; Deoxys-D taunt stall Groudon, Suicune absorb Waters/resist Ground. Jirachi preserve for anti-Dragon/Steel.\n\nSwitched to Deoxys-D to counter likely Groudon switch-in; monitor for Drought activation and confirm opponent's remaining team (Groudon/Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja?). Deoxys-D plan: Taunt on setup, Knock Off LO/Choice, Seismic Toss to chip/pressure, Recover as needed. If not Groudon, adapt: vs Rayquaza Taunt/Seismic, vs Lugia stall with Recover. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon, Suicune for Water control post-weather change. Kyogre at 18% - if stays, Seismic Toss likely KOs (100 flat >18%). Update damage tracking post-turn."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Kyogre is at 24% HP, and Seismic Toss deals fixed 100 damage, which will KO it if it stays in. Deoxys-D's high special defense (435) can potentially tank a Thunder from Kyogre (estimated ~40-60% damage based on stats and rain accuracy), but even if it hits first (Kyogre likely faster with ~300 Speed vs. Deoxys-D's 240), KOing Kyogre removes a major rain threat and gains momentum. If opponent switches (likely to Groudon to counter rain with Drought), Seismic Toss still chips 100 damage on the incoming Pokémon, which is neutral on most common switches like Groudon (Normal/Fire/Ground). Taunt could prevent setup on a switch-in, but chipping is more immediately valuable. Recover is unnecessary at full HP; Knock Off is less damaging without knowing item specifics. Switching out risks Kyogre chipping or statusing the incoming mon. Overall, Seismic Toss forces a response and advances position.", "action": "seismictoss", "scratchpad": "Kyogre at 24% pre-turn; Seismic Toss expected KO if stays, or 100 chip on switch-in (predict Groudon Drought activation, ending rain - prep Suicune for bulk vs Fire/Ground).

Opp remaining: Likely Groudon + Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja/Wobbuffet; track for Drought and team full reveals.

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed. Preserve Jirachi for special walling Rayquaza/Lugia threats. Opp team reveals: special Jirachi (Psychic), physical Hitmonlee (likely Brick Break/Mach Punch), Kyogre - expect Groudon/Rayquaza/Shedinja or Wobbuffet as remaining.\n\nKyogre at 87% pre-turn; Thunder from Mewtwo (SpA 447, rain boost accuracy) est. 80-100% damage, likely KO if stays. If switch expected (Groudon probable, immune to Elec but weak to Ice), reveals team; pivot to Ice Beam/Suicune next vs Drought/Fire. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon/Rayquaza/setup mon. Mewtwo post-KO setup with CM if safe; Deoxys-D taunt stall Groudon, Suicune absorb Waters/resist Ground. Jirachi preserve for anti-Dragon/Steel.\n\nSwitched to Deoxys-D to counter likely Groudon switch-in; monitor for Drought activation and confirm opponent's remaining team (Groudon/Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja?). Deoxys-D plan: Taunt on setup, Knock Off LO/Choice, Seismic Toss to chip/pressure, Recover as needed. If not Groudon, adapt: vs Rayquaza Taunt/Seismic, vs Lugia stall with Recover. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon, Suicune for Water control post-weather change. Kyogre at 18% - if stays, Seismic Toss likely KOs (100 flat >18%). Update damage tracking post-turn.\n\nKyogre at 24% pre-turn; Seismic Toss expected KO if stays, or 100 chip on switch-in (predict Groudon Drought activation, ending rain - prep Suicune for bulk vs Fire/Ground). If Groudon switches, Taunt next turn to block setup (Swords Dance/Stealth Rock), then stall with Recover/Seismic Toss/Knock Off LO. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon + Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja/Wobbuffet; track for Drought and team full reveals.

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed. Preserve Jirachi for special walling Rayquaza/Lugia threats. Opp team reveals: special Jirachi (Psychic), physical Hitmonlee (likely Brick Break/Mach Punch), Kyogre - expect Groudon/Rayquaza/Shedinja or Wobbuffet as remaining.\n\nKyogre at 87% pre-turn; Thunder from Mewtwo (SpA 447, rain boost accuracy) est. 80-100% damage, likely KO if stays. If switch expected (Groudon probable, immune to Elec but weak to Ice), reveals team; pivot to Ice Beam/Suicune next vs Drought/Fire. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon/Rayquaza/setup mon. Mewtwo post-KO setup with CM if safe; Deoxys-D taunt stall Groudon, Suicune absorb Waters/resist Ground. Jirachi preserve for anti-Dragon/Steel.\n\nSwitched to Deoxys-D to counter likely Groudon switch-in; monitor for Drought activation and confirm opponent's remaining team (Groudon/Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja?). Deoxys-D plan: Taunt on setup, Knock Off LO/Choice, Seismic Toss to chip/pressure, Recover as needed. If not Groudon, adapt: vs Rayquaza Taunt/Seismic, vs Lugia stall with Recover. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon, Suicune for Water control post-weather change. Kyogre at 18% - if stays, Seismic Toss likely KOs (100 flat >18%). Update damage tracking post-turn.\n\nKyogre at 24% pre-turn; Seismic Toss expected KO if stays, or 100 chip on switch-in (predict Groudon Drought activation, ending rain - prep Suicune for bulk vs Fire/Ground). If Groudon switches, Taunt next turn to block setup (Swords Dance/Stealth Rock), then stall with Recover/Seismic Toss/Knock Off LO. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon + Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja/Wobbuffet; track for Drought and team full reveals. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel walls, Suicune for post-rain Water absorb and phazing. Deoxys-D stall role confirmed effective vs physical threats.\n\nGyarados revealed: Intimidate, female, full HP, unknown item - likely DD sweeper with Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang in rain (boosted STAB). Taunt to block setup; follow with Seismic Toss (100 fixed dmg) or Knock Off (remove item, 1.5x if held). Opp team: special Jirachi (Psychic/Leftovers), phys Hitmonlee (Fighting), Kyogre (Drizzle/Thunder/Leftovers), Gyarados - remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (anti-rain)/Lugia (stall) or more rain abusers like Kingdra/Feratron. Preserve Suicune for Calm Mind/Surf post-rain or vs Fire/Ground; Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel. If Gyarados EQs, Deoxys-D tanks ~50-70% est. with high SpD/Def; Recover if needed. Track item reveal via Knock Off.\n\nGyarados set: Physical DD sweeper likely (Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang inferred + Double-Edge), Intimidate/Leftovers. Taunt blocks setup; plan stall with SToss chip/Knock Off LO removal/Recover. If Waterfall, tank neutral (~40% est. rain boost); EQ neutral (~50% est.). After Taunt expires (turn 12), re-Taunt or switch if DD starts. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (Drought/Mega anti-rain) or Lugia (stall/special wall) - Deoxys stalls physical, Jirachi walls special/Dragon, Suicune absorbs Water/resists Fire.

Deoxys outspeeds Gyarados (Spe 240 vs. base 81) and can Taunt first to prevent setup. Staying in Deoxys allows continued stalling with Recover, Seismic Toss for chip (does ~29% based on prior turn), and Knock Off later to remove Leftovers. Switching to Jirachi would wall Gyarados's Water/Flying/Normal moves (resists Water and Flying), but Taunt is needed now to maintain control; Jirachi can pivot in later for special pressure with Psychic (~neutral on Gyarados) or Fire Punch (resisted). Rain persists, boosting Gyarados's Water moves, but Deoxys's high defenses (Def 356, SpD 435) can tank a hit (estimated ~25-30% from Double-Edge/Waterfall). Preserve Suicune for post-rain Water control and anti-Ground/Fire.

If KO'd, pivot Jirachi (walls phys Water/Fly/Norm) for cleanup or Suicune absorb Water/resist Fire/Ground. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (anti-rain setup) + Lugia (special wall)/Arceus/etc.; track switches for Drought/Mega reveals and full team.

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed. Preserve Jirachi for special walling Rayquaza/Lugia threats. Opp team reveals: special Jirachi (Psychic), physical Hitmonlee (likely Brick Break/Mach Punch), Kyogre - expect Groudon/Rayquaza/Shedinja or Wobbuffet as remaining.\n\nKyogre at 87% pre-turn; Thunder from Mewtwo (SpA 447, rain boost accuracy) est. 80-100% damage, likely KO if stays. If switch expected (Groudon probable, immune to Elec but weak to Ice), reveals team; pivot to Ice Beam/Suicune next vs Drought/Fire. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon/Rayquaza/setup mon. Mewtwo post-KO setup with CM if safe; Deoxys-D taunt stall Groudon, Suicune absorb Waters/resist Ground. Jirachi preserve for anti-Dragon/Steel.\n\nSwitched to Deoxys-D to counter likely Groudon switch-in; monitor for Drought activation and confirm opponent's remaining team (Groudon/Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja?). Deoxys-D plan: Taunt on setup, Knock Off LO/Choice, Seismic Toss to chip/pressure, Recover as needed. If not Groudon, adapt: vs Rayquaza Taunt/Seismic, vs Lugia stall with Recover. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon, Suicune for Water control post-weather change. Kyogre at 18% - if stays, Seismic Toss likely KOs (100 flat >18%). Update damage tracking post-turn.\n\nKyogre at 24% pre-turn; Seismic Toss expected KO if stays, or 100 chip on switch-in (predict Groudon Drought activation, ending rain - prep Suicune for bulk vs Fire/Ground). If Groudon switches, Taunt next turn to block setup (Swords Dance/Stealth Rock), then stall with Recover/Seismic Toss/Knock Off LO. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon + Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja/Wobbuffet; track for Drought and team full reveals. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel walls, Suicune for post-rain Water absorb and phazing. Deoxys-D stall role confirmed effective vs physical threats.\n\nGyarados revealed: Intimidate, female, full HP, unknown item - likely DD sweeper with Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang in rain (boosted STAB). Taunt to block setup; follow with Seismic Toss (100 fixed dmg) or Knock Off (remove item, 1.5x if held). Opp team: special Jirachi (Psychic/Leftovers), phys Hitmonlee (Fighting), Kyogre (Drizzle/Thunder/Leftovers), Gyarados - remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (anti-rain)/Lugia (stall) or more rain abusers like Kingdra/Feratron. Preserve Suicune for Calm Mind/Surf post-rain or vs Fire/Ground; Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel. If Gyarados EQs, Deoxys-D tanks ~50-70% est. with high SpD/Def; Recover if needed. Track item reveal via Knock Off.\n\nGyarados set: Physical DD sweeper likely (Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang inferred + Double-Edge), Intimidate/Leftovers. Taunt blocks setup; plan stall with SToss chip/Knock Off LO removal/Recover. If Waterfall, tank neutral (~40% est. rain boost); EQ neutral (~50% est.). After Taunt expires (turn 12), re-Taunt or switch if DD starts. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (Drought/Mega anti-rain) or Lugia (stall/special wall) - Deoxys stalls physical, Jirachi walls special/Dragon, Suicune absorbs Water/resists Fire. Track weather change on KO/switch.\n\nGyarados set confirmed: Physical DD sweeper with Double-Edge, Intimidate/Leftovers; likely Waterfall (rain STAB), EQ, Bounce, Ice Fang. Taunt to block DD; next turns: SToss chip if attacks, Knock Off LO after, Recover as needed (tanks ~25-30% per hit). If KO'd, pivot Jirachi (walls phys Water/Fly/Norm) for cleanup or Suicune absorb Water/resist Fire/Ground. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (anti-rain setup) + Lugia (special wall)/Arceus/etc.; track switches for Drought/Mega reveals and full team. Deoxys stall role key vs physical threats; aim to wear down Gyarados to <100 HP actual for SToss KO range."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Deoxys is faster than Gyarados (240 > 81 Speed), allowing it to Recover before any attack. Recover heals 152 HP (half of 304), bringing Deoxys from 80 to 232 HP. Gyarados is expected to continue with Double-Edge, dealing approximately 75-95 damage based on prior turns (avg ~85), leaving Deoxys at ~147 HP post-hit. End-of-turn Leftovers heals 19 HP to ~166 HP total, safely above 50% and ready for continued stalling. This avoids the risk of low HP from Taunting or Seismic Tossing this turn. Opponent's Taunt expires at turn end, so next turn Deoxys can Taunt first to prevent Dragon Dance, then chip with Seismic Toss (100 fixed damage would KO from current ~191 HP after next turn's exchanges). Switching risks revealing Suicune early or unnecessary damage; staying maintains Deoxys' stall role. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Lugia), Recover still benefits Deoxys safely with no incoming damage.", "action": "recover", "scratchpad": "Recover secures Deoxys bulk for ongoing stall; next turn Taunt to block DD, follow with SToss (KO Gyarados post-chip) or Knock Off (if item pressure needed, but LO confirmed via heals). Damage tracking: Double-Edge ~25-30% to Deoxys; SToss fixed 100 (~33% to Gyarados). If opp switches this turn (low likelihood, as Gyarados pressuring), new mon (likely Rayquaza Mega - weak to Jirachi Fire Punch/Steel; or Lugia - Deoxys stalls with Taunt/Recover, Jirachi walls special) revealed - pivot Jirachi vs Dragon/Flying, Suicune vs Ground/Fire post-rain. Opp team: 4 revealed (offense-heavy rain core), remaining 2 likely Rayquaza + bulky (Lugia/Arceus) for late-game; aim to wear Gyarados, then cleanup with Mewtwo?

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed. Preserve Jirachi for special walling Rayquaza/Lugia threats. Opp team reveals: special Jirachi (Psychic), physical Hitmonlee (likely Brick Break/Mach Punch), Kyogre - expect Groudon/Rayquaza/Shedinja or Wobbuffet as remaining.\n\nKyogre at 87% pre-turn; Thunder from Mewtwo (SpA 447, rain boost accuracy) est. 80-100% damage, likely KO if stays. If switch expected (Groudon probable, immune to Elec but weak to Ice), reveals team; pivot to Ice Beam/Suicune next vs Drought/Fire. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon/Rayquaza/setup mon. Mewtwo post-KO setup with CM if safe; Deoxys-D taunt stall Groudon, Suicune absorb Waters/resist Ground. Jirachi preserve for anti-Dragon/Steel.\n\nSwitched to Deoxys-D to counter likely Groudon switch-in; monitor for Drought activation and confirm opponent's remaining team (Groudon/Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja?). Deoxys-D plan: Taunt on setup, Knock Off LO/Choice, Seismic Toss to chip/pressure, Recover as needed. If not Groudon, adapt: vs Rayquaza Taunt/Seismic, vs Lugia stall with Recover. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon, Suicune for Water control post-weather change. Kyogre at 18% - if stays, Seismic Toss likely KOs (100 flat >18%). Update damage tracking post-turn.\n\nKyogre at 24% pre-turn; Seismic Toss expected KO if stays, or 100 chip on switch-in (predict Groudon Drought activation, ending rain - prep Suicune for bulk vs Fire/Ground). If Groudon switches, Taunt next turn to block setup (Swords Dance/Stealth Rock), then stall with Recover/Seismic Toss/Knock Off LO. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon + Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja/Wobbuffet; track for Drought and team full reveals. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel walls, Suicune for post-rain Water absorb and phazing. Deoxys-D stall role confirmed effective vs physical threats.\n\nGyarados revealed: Intimidate, female, full HP, unknown item - likely DD sweeper with Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang in rain (boosted STAB). Taunt to block setup; follow with Seismic Toss (100 fixed dmg) or Knock Off (remove item, 1.5x if held). Opp team: special Jirachi (Psychic/Leftovers), phys Hitmonlee (Fighting), Kyogre (Drizzle/Thunder/Leftovers), Gyarados - remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (anti-rain)/Lugia (stall) or more rain abusers like Kingdra/Feratron. Preserve Suicune for Calm Mind/Surf post-rain or vs Fire/Ground; Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel. If Gyarados EQs, Deoxys-D tanks ~50-70% est. with high SpD/Def; Recover if needed. Track item reveal via Knock Off.\n\nGyarados set: Physical DD sweeper likely (Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang inferred + Double-Edge), Intimidate/Leftovers. Taunt blocks setup; plan stall with SToss chip/Knock Off LO removal/Recover. If Waterfall, tank neutral (~40% est. rain boost); EQ neutral (~50% est.). After Taunt expires (turn 12), re-Taunt or switch if DD starts. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (Drought/Mega anti-rain) or Lugia (stall/special wall) - Deoxys stalls physical, Jirachi walls special/Dragon, Suicune absorbs Water/resists Fire. Track weather change on KO/switch.\n\nGyarados set confirmed: Physical DD sweeper with Double-Edge, Intimidate/Leftovers; likely Waterfall (rain STAB), EQ, Bounce, Ice Fang. Taunt to block DD; next turns: SToss chip if attacks, Knock Off LO after, Recover as needed (tanks ~25-30% per hit). If KO'd, pivot Jirachi (walls phys Water/Fly/Norm) for cleanup or Suicune absorb Water/resist Fire/Ground. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (anti-rain setup) + Lugia (special wall)/Arceus/etc.; track switches for Drought/Mega reveals and full team. Deoxys stall role key vs physical threats; aim to wear down Gyarados to <100 HP actual for SToss KO range.\n\nRecover secures Deoxys bulk for ongoing stall; next turn Taunt to block DD, follow with SToss (KO Gyarados post-chip) or Knock Off (if item pressure needed, but LO confirmed via heals). Damage tracking: Double-Edge ~25-30% to Deoxys; SToss fixed 100 (~33% to Gyarados). If opp switches this turn (low likelihood, as Gyarados pressuring), new mon (likely Rayquaza Mega - weak to Jirachi Fire Punch/Steel; or Lugia - Deoxys stalls with Taunt/Recover, Jirachi walls special) revealed - pivot Jirachi vs Dragon/Flying, Suicune vs Ground/Fire post-rain. Opp team: 4 revealed (offense-heavy rain core), remaining 2 likely Rayquaza + bulky (Lugia/Arceus) for late-game; aim to wear Gyarados, then cleanup with Mewtwo? Wait no, Mewtwo fainted - Jirachi CM sweep or Suicune CM/Surf."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Deoxys-Defense has fainted from Gyarados's Double-Edge on turn 12, leaving Jirachi (50% HP) and Suicune (full HP) as remaining options. Opponent's Gyarados is at 56% HP, taunted (second Taunt from turn 11, lasts until end of turn 13), and using physical attacks like Double-Edge. Rain is still active (11 turns, but upkeep shown). Jirachi (Steel/Psychic) is the ideal switch-in as it resists Double-Edge (Normal, 0.5x via Steel), Waterfall (Water, 0.5x via Steel, even with rain boost), and Bounce (Flying, 0.5x via Steel), while being immune to Earthquake (Ground via opponent's Flying typing). Suicune (Water) risks super-effective Earthquake (common coverage on Gyarados) and neutral damage from Waterfall/Double-Edge. Jirachi can safely wall, chip with Psychic (neutral, ~25-35% estimated damage based on SpA 299 vs. assumed SpD ~150-200), or set up Calm Mind for sweeps against remaining threats (likely Rayquaza/Lugia).

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed. Preserve Jirachi for special walling Rayquaza/Lugia threats. Opp team reveals: special Jirachi (Psychic), physical Hitmonlee (likely Brick Break/Mach Punch), Kyogre - expect Groudon/Rayquaza/Shedinja or Wobbuffet as remaining.\n\nKyogre at 87% pre-turn; Thunder from Mewtwo (SpA 447, rain boost accuracy) est. 80-100% damage, likely KO if stays. If switch expected (Groudon probable, immune to Elec but weak to Ice), reveals team; pivot to Ice Beam/Suicune next vs Drought/Fire. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon/Rayquaza/setup mon. Mewtwo post-KO setup with CM if safe; Deoxys-D taunt stall Groudon, Suicune absorb Waters/resist Ground. Jirachi preserve for anti-Dragon/Steel.\n\nSwitched to Deoxys-D to counter likely Groudon switch-in; monitor for Drought activation and confirm opponent's remaining team (Groudon/Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja?). Deoxys-D plan: Taunt on setup, Knock Off LO/Choice, Seismic Toss to chip/pressure, Recover as needed. If not Groudon, adapt: vs Rayquaza Taunt/Seismic, vs Lugia stall with Recover. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon, Suicune for Water control post-weather change. Kyogre at 18% - if stays, Seismic Toss likely KOs (100 flat >18%). Update damage tracking post-turn.\n\nKyogre at 24% pre-turn; Seismic Toss expected KO if stays, or 100 chip on switch-in (predict Groudon Drought activation, ending rain - prep Suicune for bulk vs Fire/Ground). If Groudon switches, Taunt next turn to block setup (Swords Dance/Stealth Rock), then stall with Recover/Seismic Toss/Knock Off LO. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon + Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja/Wobbuffet; track for Drought and team full reveals. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel walls, Suicune for post-rain Water absorb and phazing. Deoxys-D stall role confirmed effective vs physical threats.\n\nGyarados revealed: Intimidate, female, full HP, unknown item - likely DD sweeper with Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang in rain (boosted STAB). Taunt to block setup; follow with Seismic Toss (100 fixed dmg) or Knock Off (remove item, 1.5x if held). Opp team: special Jirachi (Psychic/Leftovers), phys Hitmonlee (Fighting), Kyogre (Drizzle/Thunder/Leftovers), Gyarados - remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (anti-rain)/Lugia (stall) or more rain abusers like Kingdra/Feratron. Preserve Suicune for Calm Mind/Surf post-rain or vs Fire/Ground; Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel. If Gyarados EQs, Deoxys-D tanks ~50-70% est. with high SpD/Def; Recover if needed. Track item reveal via Knock Off.\n\nGyarados set: Physical DD sweeper likely (Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang inferred + Double-Edge), Intimidate/Leftovers. Taunt blocks setup; plan stall with SToss chip/Knock Off LO removal/Recover. If Waterfall, tank neutral (~40% est. rain boost); EQ neutral (~50% est.). After Taunt expires (turn 12), re-Taunt or switch if DD starts. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (Drought/Mega anti-rain) or Lugia (stall/special wall) - Deoxys stalls physical, Jirachi walls special/Dragon, Suicune absorbs Water/resists Fire. Track weather change on KO/switch.\n\nGyarados set confirmed: Physical DD sweeper with Double-Edge, Intimidate/Leftovers; likely Waterfall (rain STAB), EQ, Bounce, Ice Fang. Taunt to block DD; next turns: SToss chip if attacks, Knock Off LO after, Recover as needed (tanks ~25-30% per hit). If KO'd, pivot Jirachi (walls phys Water/Fly/Norm) for cleanup or Suicune absorb Water/resist Fire/Ground. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (anti-rain setup) + Lugia (special wall)/Arceus/etc.; track switches for Drought/Mega reveals and full team. Deoxys stall role key vs physical threats; aim to wear down Gyarados to <100 HP actual for SToss KO range.\n\nRecover secures Deoxys bulk for ongoing stall; next turn Taunt to block DD, follow with SToss (KO Gyarados post-chip) or Knock Off (if item pressure needed, but LO confirmed via heals). Damage tracking: Double-Edge ~25-30% to Deoxys; SToss fixed 100 (~33% to Gyarados). If opp switches this turn (low likelihood, as Gyarados pressuring), new mon (likely Rayquaza Mega - weak to Jirachi Fire Punch/Steel; or Lugia - Deoxys stalls with Taunt/Recover, Jirachi walls special) revealed - pivot Jirachi vs Dragon/Flying, Suicune vs Ground/Fire post-rain. Opp team: 4 revealed (offense-heavy rain core), remaining 2 likely Rayquaza + bulky (Lugia/Arceus) for late-game; aim to wear Gyarados, then cleanup with Mewtwo? Wait no, Mewtwo fainted - Jirachi CM sweep or Suicune CM/Surf.\n\nDeoxys fainted; Jirachi switch to wall Gyarados (resists physical attacks, immune EQ). Setup CM if safe, chip with Psychic (~25-35% to 56% HP, potential KO next). Suicune preserve for late-game Water absorb/phazing vs potential Rayquaza/Lugia/Arceus remaining. Opp team: 4 revealed (offense rain core), 2 unknown likely anti-rain (Rayquaza Drought) + bulky wall. Rain active but ending soon (11 turns); track weather change on Gyarados KO/switch.

Gyarados at 62% HP; Psychic (STAB SpA 299 vs. assumed SpD ~200) estimated 50-70% damage, likely KO given prior chip and rain not boosting Psychic.

watch for potential Choice/Assault Vest or setup. Mirror matchup favors aggressive STAB/Dark coverage. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup, pivot to Deoxys-D for stall/taunt if needed, Mewtwo for late-game sweep, Suicune for bulk/water control. Track opponent reveals for full team composition.\n\nOpponent Jirachi used Psychic (special attacker confirmed, low physical bulk likely). Fire Punch super effective for chip/KO pressure. Watch for potential switches to Fire resists (e.g., Water/Dragon types) or items like AV. If opponent switches, pivot to Mewtwo for special sweep or Suicune for bulk. Track damage: HP Dark did 21% last turn; expect Fire Punch ~30-40% based on stats.\n\nOpponent Jirachi likely KO'd this turn via Fire Punch; track switch-in for type/item reveals. Previous damage confirms opponent's special set with moderate power. Maintain Jirachi as wall if needed, but prepare Mewtwo Calm Mind sweep opportunity post-elimination. Watch for common Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon on opp side.\n\nHitmonlee revealed: pure Fighting, physical attacker (low SpD ~base 110), likely priority Mach Punch but resisted. Outs peed by Jirachi; Psychic chunks hard for potential KO or cripple. Opponent team so far: special Jirachi (fainted), Hitmonlee - suspect mixed offense, watch for switches to Waters/Dragons or steels. Maintain Jirachi active to wall physical threats; prep Mewtwo for special sweep if opp reveals physical walls. Damage tracking: Psychic expected 50-80% on full HP Hitmonlee.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle confirmed, special Water threat (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/Ice Beam, Choice? Leftovers?). Rain boosts Water 50%, threatens Mewtwo/Suicune (super effective Thunder on Suicune). Jirachi walls Surf, chips with Psychic (~25-35% est. on full HP). Next: If Kyogre low, switch Mewtwo for sweep; Deoxys-D Taunt/stall if setup suspected. Suicune for Water absorb/phazing but preserve for late rain control. Opp team: Special Jirachi, phys Hitmonlee, Kyogre - expect Groudon/Lugia/another sweeper. Track switches for full reveals.\n\nKyogre confirmed special attacker with Thunder coverage (likely Surf/Thunder/Calm Mind/ Ice Beam or Choice Scarf, Leftovers). Damage calcs: Kyogre Thunder ~56% to Jirachi (SpD 236); ~59% to Mewtwo (SpD 216) on switch-in. Mewtwo Thunder est. 70-80%+ to Kyogre (SpA 447 vs. assumed SpD ~280). After KO, opp likely switches Groudon (Drought counter to rain) - Mewtwo weak to Fire/Earthquake, pivot to Deoxys-D stall or Suicune absorb Water if needed. Preserve Jirachi for special walling Rayquaza/Lugia threats. Opp team reveals: special Jirachi (Psychic), physical Hitmonlee (likely Brick Break/Mach Punch), Kyogre - expect Groudon/Rayquaza/Shedinja or Wobbuffet as remaining.\n\nKyogre at 87% pre-turn; Thunder from Mewtwo (SpA 447, rain boost accuracy) est. 80-100% damage, likely KO if stays. If switch expected (Groudon probable, immune to Elec but weak to Ice), reveals team; pivot to Ice Beam/Suicune next vs Drought/Fire. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon/Rayquaza/setup mon. Mewtwo post-KO setup with CM if safe; Deoxys-D taunt stall Groudon, Suicune absorb Waters/resist Ground. Jirachi preserve for anti-Dragon/Steel.\n\nSwitched to Deoxys-D to counter likely Groudon switch-in; monitor for Drought activation and confirm opponent's remaining team (Groudon/Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja?). Deoxys-D plan: Taunt on setup, Knock Off LO/Choice, Seismic Toss to chip/pressure, Recover as needed. If not Groudon, adapt: vs Rayquaza Taunt/Seismic, vs Lugia stall with Recover. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon, Suicune for Water control post-weather change. Kyogre at 18% - if stays, Seismic Toss likely KOs (100 flat >18%). Update damage tracking post-turn.\n\nKyogre at 24% pre-turn; Seismic Toss expected KO if stays, or 100 chip on switch-in (predict Groudon Drought activation, ending rain - prep Suicune for bulk vs Fire/Ground). If Groudon switches, Taunt next turn to block setup (Swords Dance/Stealth Rock), then stall with Recover/Seismic Toss/Knock Off LO. Opp remaining: Likely Groudon + Rayquaza/Lugia/Shedinja/Wobbuffet; track for Drought and team full reveals. Preserve Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel walls, Suicune for post-rain Water absorb and phazing. Deoxys-D stall role confirmed effective vs physical threats.\n\nGyarados revealed: Intimidate, female, full HP, unknown item - likely DD sweeper with Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang in rain (boosted STAB). Taunt to block setup; follow with Seismic Toss (100 fixed dmg) or Knock Off (remove item, 1.5x if held). Opp team: special Jirachi (Psychic/Leftovers), phys Hitmonlee (Fighting), Kyogre (Drizzle/Thunder/Leftovers), Gyarados - remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (anti-rain)/Lugia (stall) or more rain abusers like Kingdra/Feratron. Preserve Suicune for Calm Mind/Surf post-rain or vs Fire/Ground; Jirachi for anti-Dragon/Steel. If Gyarados EQs, Deoxys-D tanks ~50-70% est. with high SpD/Def; Recover if needed. Track item reveal via Knock Off.\n\nGyarados set: Physical DD sweeper likely (Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang inferred + Double-Edge), Intimidate/Leftovers. Taunt blocks setup; plan stall with SToss chip/Knock Off LO removal/Recover. If Waterfall, tank neutral (~40% est. rain boost); EQ neutral (~50% est.). After Taunt expires (turn 12), re-Taunt or switch if DD starts. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (Drought/Mega anti-rain) or Lugia (stall/special wall) - Deoxys stalls physical, Jirachi walls special/Dragon, Suicune absorbs Water/resists Fire. Track weather change on KO/switch.\n\nGyarados set confirmed: Physical DD sweeper with Double-Edge, Intimidate/Leftovers; likely Waterfall (rain STAB), EQ, Bounce, Ice Fang. Taunt to block DD; next turns: SToss chip if attacks, Knock Off LO after, Recover as needed (tanks ~25-30% per hit). If KO'd, pivot Jirachi (walls phys Water/Fly/Norm) for cleanup or Suicune absorb Water/resist Fire/Ground. Opp remaining 2: Likely Rayquaza (anti-rain setup) + Lugia (special wall)/Arceus/etc.; track switches for Drought/Mega reveals and full team. Deoxys stall role key vs physical threats; aim to wear down Gyarados to <100 HP actual for SToss KO range.\n\nRecover secures Deoxys bulk for ongoing stall; next turn Taunt to block DD, follow with SToss (KO Gyarados post-chip) or Knock Off (if item pressure needed, but LO confirmed via heals). Damage tracking: Double-Edge ~25-30% to Deoxys; SToss fixed 100 (~33% to Gyarados). If opp switches this turn (low likelihood, as Gyarados pressuring), new mon (likely Rayquaza Mega - weak to Jirachi Fire Punch/Steel; or Lugia - Deoxys stalls with Taunt/Recover, Jirachi walls special) revealed - pivot Jirachi vs Dragon/Flying, Suicune vs Ground/Fire post-rain. Opp team: 4 revealed (offense-heavy rain core), remaining 2 likely Rayquaza + bulky (Lugia/Arceus) for late-game; aim to wear Gyarados, then cleanup with Mewtwo? Wait no, Mewtwo fainted - Jirachi CM sweep or Suicune CM/Surf.\n\nDeoxys fainted; Jirachi switch to wall Gyarados (resists physical attacks, immune EQ). Setup CM if safe, chip with Psychic (~25-35% to 56% HP, potential KO next). Suicune preserve for late-game Water absorb/phazing vs potential Rayquaza/Lugia/Arceus remaining. Opp team: 4 revealed (offense rain core), 2 unknown likely anti-rain (Rayquaza Drought) + bulky wall. Rain active but ending soon (11 turns); track weather change on Gyarados KO/switch. Gyarados likely moves: Waterfall/EQ/Bounce/Ice Fang - all low threat to Jirachi.\n\nPsychic predicted KO on Gyarados (62% HP); track exact damage for calcs. If KO, rain ends (turn 13 upkeep)—prep Suicune for Drought/Fire if Rayquaza/Groudon switches (but Groudon not revealed, likely Rayquaza Mega anti-rain + Lugia/Arceus bulky). Opp team: 4 offense rain (fainted special Jirachi/Hitmonlee/Kyogre/Gyarados), remaining 2: Rayquaza (setup threat, Jirachi walls Dragon/Fire Punch) + special wall (Lugia? stall with Roar phaze). Jirachi post-KO: CM if safe vs. special, or chip Psychic. Suicune key for final sweep (CM/Surf vs. weakened, Roar vs. setup). Deoxys/Mewtwo out—focus preserve Jirachi bulk for cleanup."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Jirachi outspeeds Gyarados (328 Spe vs base 81) and can easily KO it with Psychic, a STAB special move that previously dealt ~40% damage when Gyarados was healthier.

Post-KO, assess switch-in: Stay Jirachi to wall physical/Dragon, pivot Suicune vs special/Ground post-rain if changed.

Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt).

This secures the KO, removes their lead, and allows momentum gain without unnecessary setup or switching.

Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready).

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gyarados is currently Taunted, preventing any setup attempts like Dragon Dance, and we've confirmed it's a physical attacker with Double-Edge. Deoxys-Defense outspeeds Gyarados and can tank another hit if needed due to its high Defense and Leftovers recovery, but chipping is priority to weaken it further. Seismic Toss deals fixed 100 damage, providing a consistent chunk regardless of whether the opponent stays in or switches out (good neutral pressure on potential incoming threats). This maintains momentum without overcommitting; Taunt is redundant as it's already applied, Recover can wait until after the chip to maximize pressure, and Knock Off is less reliable damage-wise compared to fixed 100. Post-Toss, Gyarados will be at critically low HP, setting up for a KO from Jirachi, Mewtwo, or another pivot. Avoid switching to prevent giving opponent free momentum against our bulky core.", "action": "seismictoss", "scratchpad": "Gyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base).

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Deoxys-D is at 21% HP and slower than Gyarados, so any attack from Gyarados (likely Double-Edge or Dragon Dance) will KO it before it can act. Must switch to avoid sacking for no gain. Jirachi is the best switch-in: resists Double-Edge (0.5x), has sufficient bulk to tank even a boosted hit (previous Double-Edge dealt ~100 damage neutral to bulky Deoxys-D; resisted and with similar HP/def trade-off, Jirachi takes ~40-50 max), and threatens heavy super-effective damage with Hidden Power Fire (2x on Gyarados Water/Flying, +2 SpA boosts ensure 50%+ chunk, potential KO at 62% HP). Mewtwo risks taking too much neutral damage with low defenses (~50%+ from DE) and could be Crunched if Gyarados switches moves. Suicune walls well but has poor offensive presence against Gyarados (Surf neutral, no super-effective moves) and is better saved for bulkier threats like Tyranitar/Swampert. Post-switch, Jirachi can pressure Gyarados next turn while preserving Mewtwo for late-game sweeps. Taunt has ended, so Gyarados may Dragon Dance; Jirachi still outspeeds and can punish.", "action": "jirachi", "scratchpad": "Switched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling."}, "outcome": "win", "is_valid_response": true}

Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds.

Opponent Gyarados at 61% HP is likely to either spam Double-Edge, attempt Dragon Dance (post-Taunt expiration), or switch.

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent has switched in Kyogre with Drizzle activating rain, making Water moves stronger. My Jirachi is at -2 SpD from earlier hits, making it vulnerable to a likely OHKO from Kyogre's Water Spout or Surf in rain, even though Steel resists Water. Deoxys-D is at low HP and frail, would die easily. Mewtwo is neutral to Water but its SpD isn't enough to reliably tank a full-power rain-boosted Water move from Kyogre. Suicune, as a bulky Water type with high HP (401) and SpD (266), plus Leftovers, is the best switch-in to absorb the hit (projected ~70-90% damage at worst, survivable) and maintain momentum. From there, Suicune can Roar to phaze Kyogre or set up CM while Leftovers recovers. Jirachi's moves like Psychic would only chip ~40-50% on Kyogre but risk fainting, losing momentum.

If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt).

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game.\n\nOpp Kyogre: Drizzle confirmed, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM set (common Ubers rain abuser). Tanks Water neutrally but rain-boosted hits hard; Suicune walls best (proj ~70-90% dmg, survive w/ LO). Next: Roar to rack up hazards/setup denial or CM for special walling. If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt). Preserve Mewtwo full for CM sweeps vs final threats; use Suicune phazing to force out steels/fairies. Team healthy overall, focus on outlasting rain threats."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Suicune is a bulky special wall that can tank another hit from Kyogre, likely a Water Spout or Thunder (previous Thunder dealt ~76% from full HP, so from 30% it survives with ~7% left before Leftovers). Roar forces Kyogre out, denying any setup or continued rain pressure, and potentially brings in a more favorable matchup for my team (e.g., something Mewtwo can threaten). This maintains momentum without risking Mewtwo to a potential OHKO from Specs Water Spout in rain. Surf would deal neutral rain-boosted damage but not enough to chunk meaningfully, Calm Mind sets up but risks getting worn down, Rest puts Suicune to sleep unnecessarily. Switching now is risky: Deoxys-D too low HP to tank, Jirachi neutral to Water/Electric but less bulky than Suicune, Mewtwo faster but could be KO'd by Water Spout. Prioritize phazing to preserve Mewtwo for late-game sweeps against remaining threats.", "action": "roar", "scratchpad": "Kyogre: Drizzle, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam set; rain boosts threaten Waters but Suicune walls reliably (tanks hits, Roar phazing).

Suicune low post-Roar but recoverable later; Deoxys-D at 21% for emergency Taunt/Seismic only.

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game.\n\nOpp Kyogre: Drizzle confirmed, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM set (common Ubers rain abuser). Tanks Water neutrally but rain-boosted hits hard; Suicune walls best (proj ~70-90% dmg, survive w/ LO). Next: Roar to rack up hazards/setup denial or CM for special walling. If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt). Preserve Mewtwo full for CM sweeps vs final threats; use Suicune phazing to force out steels/fairies. Team healthy overall, focus on outlasting rain threats.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam set; rain boosts threaten Waters but Suicune walls reliably (tanks hits, Roar phazing). Post-Roar, expect switch to Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys), or bulky Ground (Suicune Roar/wall). Suicune low post-Roar but recoverable later; Deoxys-D at 21% for emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Phaze threats, chip with Jirachi, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs final 2 (likely Dragon/Ghost types). Opp remaining 3 incl. Kyogre; aim to even odds before Mewtwo cleanup."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Suicune has fainted from the previous turn's Thunder, so we must switch. Kyogre is a special Water-type attacker with Drizzle (rain active), likely running Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam for rain abuse. Switching to Mewtwo is risky as it could take a neutral Water Spout OHKO on switch-in, and we want to preserve it for late-game CM sweeps against remaining threats. Deoxys-D is at only 21% HP and may not survive a full-powered hit despite high SpD. Jirachi is the safest switch-in: Steel typing resists Water and Electric (Thunder), allowing it to tank any incoming attack easily from full health (~96%). Post-switch, Jirachi outspeeds Kyogre (328 Spe vs 90 base) and can chip with super-effective Fire Punch on the next turn while setting up further if needed. This maintains momentum, walls Kyogre reliably, and preserves key threats like Mewtwo for the final 2-3 opponents (likely Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky types).", "action": "jirachi", "scratchpad": "Switched to Jirachi vs full HP Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely). Jirachi walls Water/Electric hits; plan Fire Punch chip (~40-50% super eff physical, conservative), then CM if safe or more punches.

Remaining opp: 3 total (Kyogre +2 unknown, anticipate Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky Ground). Deoxys-D low HP: emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Chip Kyogre to low %, force switches, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs endgame (handles Dragons/Ghosts with Thunder/Ice Beam/CM).

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game.\n\nOpp Kyogre: Drizzle confirmed, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM set (common Ubers rain abuser). Tanks Water neutrally but rain-boosted hits hard; Suicune walls best (proj ~70-90% dmg, survive w/ LO). Next: Roar to rack up hazards/setup denial or CM for special walling. If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt). Preserve Mewtwo full for CM sweeps vs final threats; use Suicune phazing to force out steels/fairies. Team healthy overall, focus on outlasting rain threats.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam set; rain boosts threaten Waters but Suicune walls reliably (tanks hits, Roar phazing). Post-Roar, expect switch to Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys), or bulky Ground (Suicune Roar/wall). Suicune low post-Roar but recoverable later; Deoxys-D at 21% for emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Phaze threats, chip with Jirachi, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs final 2 (likely Dragon/Ghost types). Opp remaining 3 incl. Kyogre; aim to even odds before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi vs full HP Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely). Jirachi walls Water/Electric hits; plan Fire Punch chip (~40-50% super eff physical, conservative), then CM if safe or more punches. Expect Kyogre Water Spout/Thunder spam—Pressure from switch helps PP stall if prolonged. If opp switches post-chip (e.g., to Rayquaza for resist), pivot Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam or Jirachi support. Remaining opp: 3 total (Kyogre +2 unknown, anticipate Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky Ground). Deoxys-D low HP: emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Chip Kyogre to low %, force switches, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs endgame (handles Dragons/Ghosts with Thunder/Ice Beam/CM). Suicune out; prioritize even matchup before Mewtwo cleanup."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Jirachi outspeeds Kyogre (Spe 328 vs base 90 ~270) and resists common Thunder (Steel typing) while taking neutral from Water Spout/Surf and Ice Beam, allowing a potential Calm Mind setup for better walling and neutral Psychic damage (~30-40% initial). However, Jirachi's moves lack super effective coverage against Kyogre (Psychic neutral, Fire Punch resisted, HP Dark neutral), making it a stall/chip role at best without significant threat. With only 2 Pokemon remaining on opponent's side after Kyogre (unknown but likely threats like Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky), it's crucial to eliminate Kyogre quickly to maintain momentum and preserve Mewtwo's full HP for late-game CM sweeps against the final foes. Switching Mewtwo in now is optimal: Mewtwo outspeeds (Spe 359), can OHKO Kyogre with rain-boosted Thunder (super effective, 100% acc, high SpA 447 vs Kyogre's low SpD base 150), and handles common switch-ins like Rayquaza (Thunder/Ice Beam super effective on Dragon/Flying). Deoxys-D at 21% is too frail for a safe switch-in. Jirachi can pivot back later for support if needed.

Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza/Dragapult (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam), or Arceus/Grounds (switch Jirachi stall, Deoxys Taunt if revived).

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game.\n\nOpp Kyogre: Drizzle confirmed, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM set (common Ubers rain abuser). Tanks Water neutrally but rain-boosted hits hard; Suicune walls best (proj ~70-90% dmg, survive w/ LO). Next: Roar to rack up hazards/setup denial or CM for special walling. If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt). Preserve Mewtwo full for CM sweeps vs final threats; use Suicune phazing to force out steels/fairies. Team healthy overall, focus on outlasting rain threats.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam set; rain boosts threaten Waters but Suicune walls reliably (tanks hits, Roar phazing). Post-Roar, expect switch to Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys), or bulky Ground (Suicune Roar/wall). Suicune low post-Roar but recoverable later; Deoxys-D at 21% for emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Phaze threats, chip with Jirachi, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs final 2 (likely Dragon/Ghost types). Opp remaining 3 incl. Kyogre; aim to even odds before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi vs full HP Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely). Jirachi walls Water/Electric hits; plan Fire Punch chip (~40-50% super eff physical, conservative), then CM if safe or more punches. Expect Kyogre Water Spout/Thunder spam—Pressure from switch helps PP stall if prolonged. If opp switches post-chip (e.g., to Rayquaza for resist), pivot Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam or Jirachi support. Remaining opp: 3 total (Kyogre +2 unknown, anticipate Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky Ground). Deoxys-D low HP: emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Chip Kyogre to low %, force switches, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs endgame (handles Dragons/Ghosts with Thunder/Ice Beam/CM). Suicune out; prioritize even matchup before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched Mewtwo vs full Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam); Thunder OHKO projected super eff in rain. Handles predicted switch-ins: Rayquaza (Thunder super eff on Flying), Gengar (Ice Beam neutral but CM setup post-Taunt if needed). Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza/Dragapult (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam), or Arceus/Grounds (switch Jirachi stall, Deoxys Taunt if revived). Deoxys-D emergency only (low HP); Jirachi for special walling post-Mewtwo. Focus: Secure Kyogre KO, CM Mewtwo sweeps vs endgame, aim full team advantage."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Mewtwo outspeeds Kyogre (359 Spe vs ~250 max). Opponent likely continues Thunder, which would KO Mewtwo (previous hit was 199 damage, leaving 154).

Thunder is the strongest move available: neutral Electric in rain (100% acc), high SpA Mewtwo projects ~60-70% damage on full HP Kyogre (base 110 power, no STAB but superior SpA). Ice Beam same neutral damage but no rain acc boost. Calm Mind sets up but eats KO. Self-Destruct sacs wincon unnecessarily.

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game.\n\nOpp Kyogre: Drizzle confirmed, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM set (common Ubers rain abuser). Tanks Water neutrally but rain-boosted hits hard; Suicune walls best (proj ~70-90% dmg, survive w/ LO). Next: Roar to rack up hazards/setup denial or CM for special walling. If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt). Preserve Mewtwo full for CM sweeps vs final threats; use Suicune phazing to force out steels/fairies. Team healthy overall, focus on outlasting rain threats.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam set; rain boosts threaten Waters but Suicune walls reliably (tanks hits, Roar phazing). Post-Roar, expect switch to Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys), or bulky Ground (Suicune Roar/wall). Suicune low post-Roar but recoverable later; Deoxys-D at 21% for emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Phaze threats, chip with Jirachi, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs final 2 (likely Dragon/Ghost types). Opp remaining 3 incl. Kyogre; aim to even odds before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi vs full HP Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely). Jirachi walls Water/Electric hits; plan Fire Punch chip (~40-50% super eff physical, conservative), then CM if safe or more punches. Expect Kyogre Water Spout/Thunder spam—Pressure from switch helps PP stall if prolonged. If opp switches post-chip (e.g., to Rayquaza for resist), pivot Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam or Jirachi support. Remaining opp: 3 total (Kyogre +2 unknown, anticipate Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky Ground). Deoxys-D low HP: emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Chip Kyogre to low %, force switches, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs endgame (handles Dragons/Ghosts with Thunder/Ice Beam/CM). Suicune out; prioritize even matchup before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched Mewtwo vs full Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam); Thunder OHKO projected super eff in rain. Handles predicted switch-ins: Rayquaza (Thunder super eff on Flying), Gengar (Ice Beam neutral but CM setup post-Taunt if needed). Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza/Dragapult (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam), or Arceus/Grounds (switch Jirachi stall, Deoxys Taunt if revived). Deoxys-D emergency only (low HP); Jirachi for special walling post-Mewtwo. Focus: Secure Kyogre KO, CM Mewtwo sweeps vs endgame, aim full team advantage.\n\nMewtwo Thunder vs full Kyogre: ~60-70% proj, sets up 2HKO or cleanup. If Mewtwo survives (low odds), CM next for sweeps. Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza (Thunder super eff), Gengar/Dragapult (Ice Beam neutral, Jirachi walls spec). Deoxys-D emergency Taunt only; Jirachi for stall/phaze. Focus: Eliminate Kyogre, then Mewtwo CM vs endgame even if low HP."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Mewtwo has fainted after taking another Thunder from Kyogre. Must switch.

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game.\n\nOpp Kyogre: Drizzle confirmed, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM set (common Ubers rain abuser). Tanks Water neutrally but rain-boosted hits hard; Suicune walls best (proj ~70-90% dmg, survive w/ LO). Next: Roar to rack up hazards/setup denial or CM for special walling. If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt). Preserve Mewtwo full for CM sweeps vs final threats; use Suicune phazing to force out steels/fairies. Team healthy overall, focus on outlasting rain threats.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam set; rain boosts threaten Waters but Suicune walls reliably (tanks hits, Roar phazing). Post-Roar, expect switch to Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys), or bulky Ground (Suicune Roar/wall). Suicune low post-Roar but recoverable later; Deoxys-D at 21% for emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Phaze threats, chip with Jirachi, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs final 2 (likely Dragon/Ghost types). Opp remaining 3 incl. Kyogre; aim to even odds before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi vs full HP Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely). Jirachi walls Water/Electric hits; plan Fire Punch chip (~40-50% super eff physical, conservative), then CM if safe or more punches. Expect Kyogre Water Spout/Thunder spam—Pressure from switch helps PP stall if prolonged. If opp switches post-chip (e.g., to Rayquaza for resist), pivot Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam or Jirachi support. Remaining opp: 3 total (Kyogre +2 unknown, anticipate Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky Ground). Deoxys-D low HP: emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Chip Kyogre to low %, force switches, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs endgame (handles Dragons/Ghosts with Thunder/Ice Beam/CM). Suicune out; prioritize even matchup before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched Mewtwo vs full Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam); Thunder OHKO projected super eff in rain. Handles predicted switch-ins: Rayquaza (Thunder super eff on Flying), Gengar (Ice Beam neutral but CM setup post-Taunt if needed). Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza/Dragapult (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam), or Arceus/Grounds (switch Jirachi stall, Deoxys Taunt if revived). Deoxys-D emergency only (low HP); Jirachi for special walling post-Mewtwo. Focus: Secure Kyogre KO, CM Mewtwo sweeps vs endgame, aim full team advantage.\n\nMewtwo Thunder vs full Kyogre: ~60-70% proj, sets up 2HKO or cleanup. If Mewtwo survives (low odds), CM next for sweeps. Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza (Thunder super eff), Gengar/Dragapult (Ice Beam neutral, Jirachi walls spec). Deoxys-D emergency Taunt only; Jirachi for stall/phaze. Focus: Eliminate Kyogre, then Mewtwo CM vs endgame even if low HP.\n\nKyogre at 39%, switch Jirachi to KO with Fire Punch (super eff, outspeeds). Post-KO, opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza (Jirachi chips/neutral, Deoxys Taunt phys DD), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec Psychic, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup/Seismic ~25-30% chip). Deoxys-D low (21%): Emergency use only for Taunt/Knock Off/Recover stall. Wincon: Jirachi chip/support + Deoxys pivot to force out threats, outlast with Leftovers recovery.

Watch for potential Serene Grace flinch moves like Iron Head/Thunderbolt. My team wincon: Mewtwo special sweeping post-setup, Suicune walling, Deoxys-D pivoting, Jirachi support/setup. Prioritize chipping opponent's leads, preserve Mewtwo for late-game.\n\nOpponent Jirachi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (resisted heavily by us). Likely CM or more special attacks, but we wall reliably. After CM, follow with boosted HP Dark or Psychic (still weak but better post-setup). Monitor for switches to threats like Gengar or Rayquaza. Team plan: Use Jirachi to setup/chip leads, pivot to Deoxys-D for Taunt/stall if needed, save Mewtwo for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 3: My Jirachi +1 SpA/SpD, opponent at 91%. Used second CM to reach +2. HP Dark calcs: Base ~25-30% unboosted super eff, +2 ~45-55%, enough to chunk or KO with LO if they have it (but confirmed leftovers). Watch if opponent switches to counter-setup like a physical attacker; ready to pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt if needed. Mewtwo untouched, ideal for late-game cleanup vs weakened team.\n\nTurn 4: Opted for third CM to +3. Opponent Psychic spam confirms special attacker Jirachi, likely Calm Mind or Choice Specs set, but walled effectively. Post +3 HP Dark projects ~70-80% damage, potential KO. If opponent switches (e.g., to Rayquaza or physical threat), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt next. Mewtwo/Suicune preserved; aim to wear down leads before unleashing Mewtwo sweeps.\n\nHP Dark at +3 projects ~50%+ on opp Jirachi; if they CM, still chunk them next turn. If switch to physical threat (e.g., TTar, Ray), pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt/Seismic Toss. Preserve Mewtwo for weakened foes; Suicune for walls. Opp likely special Jirachi set (CM/Psychic spam), monitor for common Ubers partners like Gengar/Salamence.\n\nTurn 6: +3 SpA Jirachi attacks with boosted HP Dark to likely KO opp Jirachi at 54%. If survives (unlikely), finish with another HP or Psychic. Watch for common switches: Gengar (super eff), Rayquaza (neutral), TTar (resisted but physical threat—pivot to Deoxys-D Taunt). Opp Jirachi confirmed as special attacker (Psychic spam, no CM yet), probably Specs or standard set without strong coverage. Team intact; Mewtwo ready for sweeps once leads are weakened. Suicune for bulky waters/grounds.\n\nTurn 7: KO opp Jirachi with +3 HP Dark (guaranteed). Opponent's Jirachi confirmed special attacker (Psychic spam, Serene Grace + LO/SpD drops on Psychic). Next likely switches: Rayquaza (watch for DD/Draco), Gengar (Taunt with Deoxys-D), TTar (pivot Suicune), or another setup sweeper (Mewtwo ready). Team healthy; aim to chip leads further with Jirachi, then unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps. Preserve Suicune for bulky matchups.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Intimidate, 100% HP, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch set (common Ubers). Weak to Electric/Rock; none on my active team, so Taunt/stall essential. Deoxys-D plan: Taunt incoming setup, Seismic Toss for chip (~25-30%), Knock Off item if possible. If Gyarados physical, Deoxys-D SpD tanks; watch for Crunch (super eff). Post-Taunt, pivot back to Jirachi or Mewtwo. Opp team remaining: Likely Rayquaza/Gengar/TTar/Salamence types; Mewtwo CM for late sweep vs non-Dark/Ghost. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds. Team healthy, focus on momentum.\n\nOpp Gyarados: Physical set confirmed (Double-Edge), Intimidate/LO, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ/DE. Taunt to stop DD/setup; Pressure helps PP stall. Seismic Toss next for 100 dmg chip (~33%), then Recover if needed or Knock Off LO. Avoid switching to preserve momentum; Mewtwo for post-chip sweep vs weakened physical threats. Suicune backup for Water/Ground matchups (e.g., Swampert/TTar if revealed). Opp remaining: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt), bulky Waters/Grounds (Suicune). Team healthy, focus on denying setups.\n\nGyarados physical (DE confirmed, likely DD/Waterfall/Crunch/EQ), Taunted for 2 more turns; Seismic Toss chips to ~0-10% (fixed 100 dmg significant on ~300 HP base). If switches, chip incoming (e.g., Rayquaza neutral, Gengar super eff KO potential). Next: Recover if pressured, then Knock Off LO or pivot to Mewtwo for sweep vs weakened physicals. Suicune for bulky Waters/Grounds; Jirachi support. Opp remaining likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo CM handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), TTar/Swampert (Suicune wall). Focus: Deny setups, chip leads, unleash Mewtwo late.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi to wall Double-Edge and threaten Gyarados with +2 Hidden Power Fire (super effective, likely 60%+ damage at 62% HP). Gyarados confirmed physical spammer (3x Double-Edge, Leftovers, no Choice due to LO heals), possible DD set now able to setup post-Taunt; Crunch/Waterfall/EQ possible coverage. If Gyarados KOs Jirachi unlikely, pivot to Mewtwo Ice Beam for cleanup. Opponent remaining 4: Expect Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles with Thunder/Ice Beam), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi Taunt or Mewtwo), bulky Grounds (Suicune), another special threat (Jirachi walls). Preserve Mewtwo full HP for CM sweeps vs weakened team; use Jirachi for chip/support, Deoxys-D sac if needed for Pressure stall, Suicune phazing/walling.\n\nGyarados at 61%, physical DD/DE set confirmed; post-Taunt, risk DD this turn—Psychic chips to ~10-20% even if boosted. If survives and DDs, next turn Psychic likely KOs +3 vs +1 Atk Gyarados (low SpD). If switches (e.g., Rayquaza/Gengar), Jirachi walls special threats, pivot Deoxys Taunt physicals. Mewtwo priority: Ice Beam/Thunder for Dragons/Electrics post-chip. Suicune for Grounds/Waters if revealed. Opp remaining: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo handles), Gengar (Taunt/Seismic), bulky (Suicune Roar). Team healthy; aim to eliminate leads before Mewtwo sweep.\n\nOpp Hitmonlee: Physical Fighting revenge killer (likely HJK, Mach Punch/Bullet Punch coverage), frail to Psychic—Jirachi +3 OHKO. Ability/item unknown, but irrelevant here. Opp remaining 3: Anticipate Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup), bulky Ground/Water (Suicune Roar/wall). After KO, switch to Mewtwo for CM setup/sweep vs weakened team; preserve Suicune for matchups. Jirachi/Deoxys for support/chip. Focus: Eliminate fast threats, deny setups, unleash Mewtwo late-game.\n\nOpp Kyogre: Drizzle confirmed, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM set (common Ubers rain abuser). Tanks Water neutrally but rain-boosted hits hard; Suicune walls best (proj ~70-90% dmg, survive w/ LO). Next: Roar to rack up hazards/setup denial or CM for special walling. If Thunder, Mewtwo resists Electric. Post-Kyogre, remaining 2 likely Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi/Deoxys Taunt). Preserve Mewtwo full for CM sweeps vs final threats; use Suicune phazing to force out steels/fairies. Team healthy overall, focus on outlasting rain threats.\n\nKyogre: Drizzle, likely Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam set; rain boosts threaten Waters but Suicune walls reliably (tanks hits, Roar phazing). Post-Roar, expect switch to Rayquaza (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam handles), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec, Deoxys Taunt phys), or bulky Ground (Suicune Roar/wall). Suicune low post-Roar but recoverable later; Deoxys-D at 21% for emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Phaze threats, chip with Jirachi, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs final 2 (likely Dragon/Ghost types). Opp remaining 3 incl. Kyogre; aim to even odds before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched to Jirachi vs full HP Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely). Jirachi walls Water/Electric hits; plan Fire Punch chip (~40-50% super eff physical, conservative), then CM if safe or more punches. Expect Kyogre Water Spout/Thunder spam—Pressure from switch helps PP stall if prolonged. If opp switches post-chip (e.g., to Rayquaza for resist), pivot Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam or Jirachi support. Remaining opp: 3 total (Kyogre +2 unknown, anticipate Rayquaza/Gengar/bulky Ground). Deoxys-D low HP: emergency Taunt/Seismic only. Focus: Chip Kyogre to low %, force switches, unleash Mewtwo CM sweeps vs endgame (handles Dragons/Ghosts with Thunder/Ice Beam/CM). Suicune out; prioritize even matchup before Mewtwo cleanup.\n\nSwitched Mewtwo vs full Kyogre (Drizzle/Specs likely Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam); Thunder OHKO projected super eff in rain. Handles predicted switch-ins: Rayquaza (Thunder super eff on Flying), Gengar (Ice Beam neutral but CM setup post-Taunt if needed). Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza/Dragapult (Mewtwo Thunder/Ice Beam), or Arceus/Grounds (switch Jirachi stall, Deoxys Taunt if revived). Deoxys-D emergency only (low HP); Jirachi for special walling post-Mewtwo. Focus: Secure Kyogre KO, CM Mewtwo sweeps vs endgame, aim full team advantage.\n\nMewtwo Thunder vs full Kyogre: ~60-70% proj, sets up 2HKO or cleanup. If Mewtwo survives (low odds), CM next for sweeps. Opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza (Thunder super eff), Gengar/Dragapult (Ice Beam neutral, Jirachi walls spec). Deoxys-D emergency Taunt only; Jirachi for stall/phaze. Focus: Eliminate Kyogre, then Mewtwo CM vs endgame even if low HP.\n\nKyogre at 39%, switch Jirachi to KO with Fire Punch (super eff, outspeeds). Post-KO, opp remaining 2: Anticipate Rayquaza (Jirachi chips/neutral, Deoxys Taunt phys DD), Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls spec Psychic, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup/Seismic ~25-30% chip). Deoxys-D low (21%): Emergency use only for Taunt/Knock Off/Recover stall. Wincon: Jirachi chip/support + Deoxys pivot to force out threats, outlast with Leftovers recovery. No Mewtwo/Suicune: Focus defense, deny setups, chip to victory.\n\nKyogre at 46%, KO'd with Psychic from full HP Jirachi. Opponent's remaining two: Anticipate Rayquaza (chip with Psychic neutral, Taunt phys DD with Deoxys-D) or Gengar/Dragapult (Jirachi walls special attacks, CM setup, Deoxys Taunt phys/setup/Seismic chip ~20-25%). Deoxys-D at 21%: Reserve for Taunt/Knock Off/Recover on physical threats only, avoid direct hits. Wincon: Jirachi CM sweeps (boost SpA for Psychic/HP Dark vs non-Steel/Dark foes) + Deoxys pivot to deny setups, chip to victory with Leftovers stall. No Mewtwo/Suicune: Emphasize defensive play, force switches, outlast endgame."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Jirachi outspeeds Kyogre (328 Spe vs base 90) and Psychic is super effective against Water, dealing massive special damage to the 28% HP Kyogre with -1 SpD. This guarantees a KO, eliminating another opponent threat. Fire Punch is also super effective but physical and less optimal given Jirachi's higher SpA. Calm Mind would waste the KO opportunity, and Hidden Power Dark is neutral and unnecessary. Switching to Deoxys-D (21% HP) is risky as it's frail and could faint to the incoming mon or even a weak hit. Post-KO, the last opponent mon will switch in—anticipate Rayquaza (chip/neutral with Psychic/Fire Punch, Taunt phys with Deoxys), Gengar/Dragapult (wall spec with Jirachi CM Psychic, Taunt phys/setup with Deoxys Seismic ~20% chip), or bulky Ground (Jirachi chips, Deoxys Taunt/Knock Off).
