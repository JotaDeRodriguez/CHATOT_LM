Consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if Mewtwo is not KO'd, but with Mewtwo at 41% HP, Earthquake has a high chance of KO'ing it.\n\nOpponent's Celebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help recover from sandstorm damage.

Celebi is at full HP, and the sandstorm is ongoing, which is affecting both sides. Metagross has 74.45% HP remaining. The available moves are meteormash, earthquake, pursuit, and explosion. Switching to lanturn or misdreavus is also an option. \n\nEarthquake is super effective against Celebi due to its Grass/Fairy typing, and since Celebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, it can recover from sandstorm damage. However, Metagross is already taking damage from Leech Seed, so using Explosion might be risky as it would KO both Metagross and Celebi, but it could also eliminate Celebi. Pursuit is a priority move that could hit Celebi if it switches out, but Celebi is currently active. Meteor Mash is a Steel-type move that is not super effective against Celebi. \n\nConsidering the current state, using Earthquake is a strong option to pressure Celebi and potentially KO it, but since Celebi has Leftovers and Natural Cure, it might survive. Alternatively, switching to Lanturn or Misdreavus could be beneficial. Lanturn has Volt Absorb, which could help with sandstorm damage, and Misdreavus has Levitate, which makes it immune to sandstorm. However, the opponent's team includes Tyranitar, which has Sandstream, so switching to a Pokémon immune to sandstorm might be a good strategy. \n\nSince Metagross is already taking damage from Leech Seed, switching to a Pokémon that can handle sandstorm and potentially counter Celebi's moves would be a better long-term strategy.

The best option is to use Taunt again to prevent Celebi from using its other moves, such as Psychic. Alternatively, Misdreavus can use Protect to avoid taking damage, but since Celebi is not attacking yet, it might be better to use Taunt to control the situation. However, considering that Celebi is already under the effect of Taunt, the next move might be to use Protect to avoid damage and wait for Celebi to act. Alternatively, using Mean Look could trap Celebi, but since it's already under Taunt, it might not be necessary. The safest move is to use Protect and wait for Celebi to act, as it's already under the effect of Taunt and might not be able to use its other moves immediately.

Salamence's Intimidate lowers Tyranitar's attack. Fire Blast is super effective against Tyranitar and has a chance to burn it. Need to consider if Tyranitar has a Fire-type move or a Fire immunity item, but since it's not revealed, proceed with Fire Blast.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo has Pressure ability, which increases the damage taken from moves. Fire Blast is super effective and can burn Mewtwo. Salamence's Leftovers help it recover from sandstorm damage. Mewtwo is at 48% HP, so Fire Blast could be a strong offensive move to pressure it. Need to monitor Mewtwo's potential moves and check if it has any status or setup moves that could be problematic.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo has Pressure ability, which increases damage taken. Fire Blast is super effective and can burn Mewtwo. Salamence's Leftovers help recover from sandstorm. Mewtwo is at 48% HP, so Fire Blast could KO it. Need to check if Mewtwo has any recovery or status moves to prepare for future turns.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo has Pressure ability, which increases damage taken. Earthquake is super effective and can KO Mewtwo. Metagross's Earthquake is a strong offensive move to take advantage of Mewtwo's low HP. Need to monitor if Mewtwo has any recovery or status moves that could be used in future turns. Consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if Mewtwo is not KO'd, but with Mewtwo at 41% HP, Earthquake has a high chance of KO'ing it.\n\nOpponent's Celebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help recover from sandstorm damage. Earthquake is super effective against Celebi. Metagross's Earthquake is a strong offensive move to take down Celebi. Need to monitor if Celebi has any recovery or status moves that could be used in future turns. Consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if Celebi is not KO'd, but with Celebi at full HP, Earthquake has a high chance of KO'ing it.\n\nCelebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help it recover from sandstorm damage. Earthquake is super effective and can KO Celebi. Metagross's Earthquake is a strong offensive move to take down Celebi. Need to monitor if Celebi has any recovery or status moves that could be used in future turns. Consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if Celebi is not KO'd, but with Celebi at full HP, Earthquake has a high chance of KO'ing it.\n\nCelebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help it recover from sandstorm damage. Switching to Misdreavus, which has Levitate and is immune to sandstorm, is a good strategy. Lanturn has Volt Absorb, which could also help with sandstorm damage. Metagross is taking damage from Leech Seed, so switching to a Pokémon that can handle sandstorm is beneficial. Misdreavus can help avoid further damage from sandstorm and potentially set up for future turns.\n\nOpponent's Celebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help it recover from sandstorm damage. Taunt is used to prevent Celebi from using Leech Seed or setting up. Misdreavus is immune to sandstorm, so it can safely use Taunt. If Celebi is forced to use a physical move, Misdreavus can recover with Leftovers. Consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if Celebi uses a powerful move after being taunted.\n\nOpponent's Celebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help recover from sandstorm damage. Misdreavus is immune to sandstorm and can use Protect to avoid damage. Celebi is under Taunt, so it can't use Leech Seed or set up. If Celebi uses a physical move, Misdreavus can recover with Leftovers. Consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if Celebi uses a powerful move after being taunted.\n\nOpponent's Celebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help it recover from sandstorm damage. Misdreavus is immune to sandstorm and can use Protect to avoid damage. Celebi is under Taunt, so it can't use Leech Seed or set up. If Celebi uses a physical move, Misdreavus can recover with Leftovers. Consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if Celebi uses a powerful move after being taunted.\n\nSwitched to Metagross to use Earthquake against Celebi, which is super effective. Need to monitor if Celebi has any recovery or status moves. Metagross's Earthquake can potentially KO Celebi, which is at 99% HP. If Earthquake doesn't KO Celebi, consider switching to a defensive Pokémon or using a status move.\n\nCelebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help it recover from sandstorm damage. Metagross's Earthquake is super effective and can KO Celebi. If Earthquake doesn't KO Celebi, consider switching to a defensive Pokémon like Lanturn, which has Volt Absorb to handle sandstorm damage. Monitor Celebi's potential moves and status effects for future turns.\n\nMetagross used Earthquake on Celebi, which is super effective. If Earthquake doesn't KO Celebi, it will continue to take damage from the sandstorm and Leech Seed. Need to monitor Celebi's HP and consider switching to a defensive Pokémon if necessary. Lanturn has Volt Absorb and can handle sandstorm damage, but Earthquake is the best immediate option to pressure Celebi.\n\nCelebi is under Leech Seed and sandstorm, but has Leftovers to recover. Earthquake is super effective and can potentially KO Celebi. If Earthquake doesn't KO Celebi, need to switch to a defensive Pokémon like Lanturn. Monitor Celebi's HP and consider using a status move if it survives. Lanturn has Volt Absorb to handle sandstorm damage but lacks strong offensive moves. Metagross's Earthquake is the best immediate option to pressure Celebi and remove the Leech Seed.\n\nOpponent's Celebi has Natural Cure and Leftovers, which help recover from sandstorm damage. Earthquake is super effective and can KO Celebi. Metagross's Earthquake is the best immediate option to pressure Celebi and remove the Leech Seed.

However, the current HP fraction in the battle log is listed as 100% for Lanturn, which might be a discrepancy. Given that Zapdos is already fainted, the next logical step is to switch in another Pokémon from the available switches, which are Forretress and Metagross. Forretress has Sturdy and can take a hit, while Metagross has Choice Band and high Attack. Considering that Lanturn is burned and has Volt Absorb, switching in Metagross with Choice Band and Earthquake could be effective as Earthquake is not super effective but can still deal damage. However, since Zapdos is fainted, we need to switch in a new Pokémon. Metagross has high Attack and Choice Band, which could be useful against Lanturn. Alternatively, Forretress can use Spikes to set up hazard control.

Opponent's item unknown. Fire Blast is strong and can OHKO if opponent doesn't have Focus Sash. Earthquake is less effective. Belly Drum risky. Switching is an option but not necessary yet.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed has Leftovers and Pressure. Fire Blast is strong, but need to be cautious about priority. Salac Berry can be used to counter Sucker Punch. Consider switching to Zapdos or Metagross if Fire Blast misses or gets priority. Keep an eye on Deoxys-Speed's health and Leftovers healing.\n\nDeoxys-Speed is using Recover and has Leftovers, which is healing it. Fire Blast is a strong move that can OHKO if it doesn't have Focus Sash. Need to be cautious about priority moves. Consider switching to Zapdos or Metagross if Fire Blast misses or gets priority. Keep an eye on Deoxys-Speed's health and Leftovers healing.\n\nOpponent's Lanturn is burned and at 54% HP. Fire Blast is super effective and can OHKO. Earthquake is not effective. Belly Drum risky but could boost Charizard's Attack. Switching is an option but not needed yet. Fire Blast is the optimal choice to finish Lanturn off.\n\nLanturn is burned and at 26% HP. Fire Blast is super effective and can OHKO. Charizard's Salac Berry boosts Speed, increasing the chance to outspeed. Consider switching to Zapdos or Metagross if Fire Blast is not enough or if Lanturn has priority moves. Keep an eye on Lanturn's status and remaining HP for future turns.\n\nMy Charizard is at 1.01% HP with Salac Berry. Opponent's Charizard has Speed boost. Lanturn is burned at 26% HP. Fire Blast is super effective but risky with low HP. Consider switching to Zapdos or Metagross to avoid losing the last Pokémon. Lanturn may switch out soon due to burn. Opponent's team includes Forretress, Zapdos, and Metagross. Switching to Zapdos could provide better coverage and pressure. Need to monitor opponent's next move and adjust strategy accordingly.\n\nSwitched to Zapdos to avoid losing the last Pokémon. Medicham has Pure Power and is at 44% HP. Zapdos can outspeed and use Thunderbolt for coverage. Monitor Medicham's moves and consider switching to Metagross if needed.\n\nOpponent's Medicham is at 44% HP with Pure Power. Thunderbolt is super effective and can OHKO. Zapdos has Leftovers for recovery. No immediate threat requiring a switch. Monitor Medicham's moves and consider switching to Metagross if needed.\n\nOpponent's Lanturn is burned at 45% HP. Thunderbolt is super effective and can OHKO. Zapdos has high Special Attack and Leftovers for recovery. Lanturn's Volt Absorb and Leftovers will heal it, but with low HP, Thunderbolt might still OHKO. Consider using Thunderbolt now to finish Lanturn off before it can heal further. Monitor Lanturn's status and remaining HP for future turns.\n\nOpponent's Lanturn is burned at 64% HP. Thunderbolt is super effective and can OHKO. Zapdos has Leftovers for recovery. Monitor Lanturn's status and remaining HP for future turns. Consider switching to Metagross if Lanturn switches out or if Thunderbolt is not effective.\n\nOpponent's Lanturn is burned at 83% HP. Thunderbolt is super effective and can OHKO. Zapdos's Leftovers provide some recovery. Monitor Lanturn's HP and status for future turns. Consider switching to Metagross if Lanturn switches out or if Thunderbolt is not effective. Keep an eye on opponent's team composition and potential switches.\n\nZapdos is fainted. Switched to Metagross to take advantage of its high Attack and Choice Band. Lanturn is burned and has Volt Absorb, which will heal it from Thunderbolt but not from Earthquake. Metagross can use Earthquake or other moves to pressure Lanturn. Monitor Lanturn's status and remaining HP for future turns. Opponent's team includes Forretress, Zapdos, and Metagross. Need to be cautious about potential switches and adjust strategy accordingly.\n\nOpponent's Lanturn is burned at 88% HP. Earthquake is super effective and can OHKO. Metagross has Choice Band and high Attack. Consider using Earthquake now to finish Lanturn off before it can heal further. Monitor Lanturn's status and remaining HP for future turns. Opponent's team includes Forretress, Zapdos, and Metagross. Be cautious about potential switches and adjust strategy accordingly.\n\nOpponent's Charizard is immune to Earthquake. Switched to Forretress for Spikes and Sturdy. Monitor opponent's moves and consider setting up Spikes or using Rapid Spin if needed.\n\nSwitched to Metagross to apply pressure with Choice Band and Earthquake.

The opponent's Lanturn is a Water-type with Volt Absorb, which makes it immune to Electric-type moves. My available switches are Charizard and Metagross. Charizard is a Fire/Flying-type with Salac Berry, which can boost its Speed when it takes damage. Metagross is a Steel/Psychic-type with Choice Band, which boosts its Attack. Lanturn's Volt Absorb means Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave won't be effective, so I should consider switching in Charizard to take advantage of its Fire-type moves against Lanturn. Fire-type moves are super effective against Water-types, so Charizard's Fire Blast or Earthquake could be good options. However, since Lanturn has Volt Absorb, it won't take damage from Electric-type moves, so I need to avoid using those. Switching in Charizard would allow me to use Fire-type moves, which are super effective against Lanturn. Metagross, being a Steel-type, is not super effective against Water-type, but it has high Attack with Choice Band. Considering the effectiveness of moves, Charizard seems like a better choice to switch in and apply pressure with Fire-type moves.

If Groudon has a status move, it might try to set up or use a status move. If not, Earthquake can be used again next turn.\n\nSwitched in Tyranitar to pressure Groudon. Tyranitar's Rock and Dark typing resists Groudon's Fire-type moves. Tyranitar can use Rock Slide and Earthquake, which are super effective against Groudon.

Need to check if Groudon has any status moves or setup abilities. If Groudon has a status move, it might try to set up or use a status move. If not, Ice Beam can be used again next turn.\n\nMewtwo used Calmmind to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense. Groudon is still active with 60% HP and has used Earthquake. The sandstorm is ongoing, which is beneficial for Mewtwo. Mewtwo's Lumberry is still intact, and it has not taken any damage from a Fire-type move yet. Groudon's Leftovers item is healing it, so it may be able to outlast Mewtwo if it continues to take damage. However, Mewtwo's setup with Calmmind will help it survive longer and deal more damage in the future. Need to monitor Groudon's HP and consider switching out if necessary. Also, need to be aware of Groudon's potential moves and abilities, such as Drought, which could be used to change the weather. If Groudon switches out, we can use our other Pokémon to pressure the new threat.\n\nMewtwo is at critical HP, but has Calmmind boosts. Groudon is using Leftovers to heal. Switching to Cradily to avoid potential KO. Cradily's Rock Slide and Earthquake are super effective against Groudon. Monitor Groudon's HP and consider using Earthquake or Rock Slide if Groudon switches out. Also, keep an eye on the sandstorm and Mewtwo's Lumberry status.\n\nUsed Rock Slide to maximize damage against Groudon. Groudon's Leftovers will heal it, but Cradily's Rock Slide is super effective. Monitor Groudon's HP and consider switching out if it's not KO'd. If Groudon switches out, use Mewtwo to pressure the new threat. Continue to use Earthquake or Rock Slide if Groudon is still active.\n\nSwitched in Mewtwo to pressure Groudon with Ice Beam. Groudon's item is Leftovers, which will heal it. Mewtwo is at low HP but has Calmmind boosts. Need to monitor Groudon's HP and consider switching out if necessary. If Groudon switches out, use our other Pokémon to pressure the new threat.

Given Mewtwo's low HP, it's risky to continue attacking, but using Ice Beam again could maximize damage before switching out. However, considering Mewtwo's low HP and the risk of being knocked out, it might be better to switch to a more durable Pokémon like Tyranitar or Cradily to continue pressuring Groudon. However, Tyranitar and Cradily are already fainted. Therefore, the best option is to use Ice Beam again to maximize damage before Mewtwo is knocked out.

Need to be cautious about Gengar's potential setup moves or status effects.\n\nSwitched to Lapras to take the next hit and stall Gengar. Gengar is a special attacker, so Lapras's high defenses and Water Absorb can help mitigate damage. Need to be cautious of Gengar's potential setup moves or status effects. If Gengar uses Thunderbolt again, Lapras will take less damage due to its typing and ability. Consider using Rest or Sleep Talk if Gengar sets up or uses status moves.\n\nUsed Ice Beam against Gengar to exploit its weakness and apply pressure. Gengar is weak to Ice, so this move can be highly effective. Need to monitor Gengar's health and consider follow-up moves or switches if Gengar starts to set up or use status moves. Lapras's Water Absorb doesn't help against Electric, but its high defense and Leftovers healing allow it to stay in longer. If Gengar switches out, we can capitalize on the switch-in with other Pokémon.

If Gengar switches out, we can follow up with other moves. Need to be cautious about Gengar's potential setup moves or status effects. Lapras's Ice Beam is effective against Gengar. Gengar has 52% HP left, so another Ice Beam could be a good option to pressure it further. If Gengar switches out, we can switch in another Pokémon. Need to monitor Gengar's potential moves and strategies, such as using status or setup moves.\n\nSwitched to Starmie to counter Gengar's special attacks with Thunderbolt. Starmie's Thunderbolt is super effective against Gengar. Need to monitor Gengar's potential moves and strategies, such as using status or setup moves.

Keep an eye on Gengar's health and consider follow-up moves or switches if Gengar starts to set up or use status moves.\n\nSwitched to Nidoking to counter Gengar's special attacks with physical moves. Nidoking's Choice Band boosts its attack, allowing it to OHKO Gengar with Earthquake or Megahorn. Gengar is weak to Ground and Psychic, so Nidoking's Earthquake is super effective. If Gengar switches out, we can follow up with other moves or switches. Need to monitor Gengar's potential moves and strategies, such as using status or setup moves. Nidoking's Poison Point ability can poison Gengar if it is hit, adding additional pressure. Consider using Earthquake to apply pressure and potentially OHKO Gengar.\n\nGengar is at 33% HP.

Nidoking's Poison Point ability can poison Gengar if it is hit, adding additional pressure.\n\nOpponent's Gengar is weak to Ground. Nidoking's Earthquake is super effective and could OHKO Gengar. Gengar might switch out, but Nidoking's high Speed gives it priority. Consider using Earthquake again to apply pressure. If Gengar switches out, we can follow up with other moves or switches.\n\nSwitched to Celebi to handle Gengar. Celebi's Leech Seed and Recover can help mitigate damage and sustain health. Gengar is weak to Psychic, so using Psychic could be effective. However, Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Ground-type moves. Need to monitor Gengar's moves and consider using Psychic or Hidden Power if Gengar continues to attack. Celebi's typing provides some resistance to Electric and Ice, which are common moves for Gengar.

Using Psychic now can capitalize on Zapdos's weakened Special Defense and apply pressure. Additionally, Celebi's Leech Seed is already active, so using Psychic can further drain Zapdos's HP while maintaining the status effect. If Zapdos switches out, Celebi can continue applying pressure with Leech Seed or recover with Leftovers.
