Salamence's Leftovers will help it recover HP in the Sandstorm. Celebi is a Grass/Psychic type, vulnerable to Dragon Claw. Salamence's Dragon Claw is super effective. Fire Blast is an option for coverage, but Dragon Claw is more reliable. Tyranitar's Dragon Dance boosts its Speed and Attack. Salamence's Leftovers help it recover in Sandstorm. Consider switching to a faster Pokémon if Tyranitar continues to set up. Celebi is at 57/100 HP, vulnerable to Dragon Claw. Salamence's Leftovers help recover in Sandstorm.

If Dragon Claw doesn't KO Celebi, consider switching to Lanturn or Metagross for more coverage or to handle Celebi's Recover and Leech Seed.\n\nSalamence is in a critical state with only 13.29% HP remaining. Switching to Metagross to handle Omastar and Leech Seed. Metagross has high attack stats and can use Meteor Mash and Earthquake to deal with Omastar. Need to be cautious of Omastar's potential moves and Leech Seed. Metagross's Clear Body ability will prevent stat changes, which is beneficial in this situation. Monitor Omastar's HP and consider switching back to Salamence if it becomes too dangerous.\n\nMetagross's Earthquake is super effective against Celebi. Clear Body prevents stat changes.

The opponent's active Pokémon is Charizard with Blaze, 100% HP, and moves like Earthquake. The opponent's team has Medicham and Lanturn, with Medicham being a fast special attacker. The opponent has set up 2 layers of Spikes. I need to consider the current situation: Charizard's Earthquake is super effective against Metagross's Steel typing, but Metagross has high Attack and Choice Band for power. Since Metagross is my only active Pokémon, I should focus on dealing damage before the opponent's next move. Earthquake is a strong move, but with 2 Spikes, it's better to prioritize damaging the opponent's Charizard before it can set up more hazards or switch out. However, since Charizard has 100% HP, I need to calculate if Earthquake can OHKO. Metagross's Earthquake has 120 power, and with Choice Band, it's boosted. Charizard has 297 HP, so 120 * 1.5 (Choice Band) = 180. Charizard's HP is 297, so 297 - 180 = 117, which is not enough for an OHKO. Therefore, I should use a different move. Meteor Mash is a Steel-type move that is super effective against Charizard's Fire/Flying typing. Meteor Mash has 120 power, and with Choice Band, it's 180. 297 - 180 = 117, same as Earthquake. However, Meteor Mash has a 10% chance to lower the opponent's Attack. Rockslide is a Rock-type move that is not very effective against Charizard's Fire/Flying typing. Therefore, the best option is to use Meteor Mash for the super effective hit and potential stat drop. If that doesn't OHKO, I can follow up with Earthquake next turn. Alternatively, using Earthquake first might be better to deal with Charizard's potential switch-out. However, since Charizard has 100% HP, it's better to use the super effective Meteor Mash first.

However, Mewtwo is also at very low HP, so it may not survive long. Alternatively, the player could try to remove the Encore effect by using a move that changes the target, but with only Dragon Dance available, it's not possible. Therefore, the best option is to switch in Mewtwo and use Thunder on Starmie to try and gain an advantage, even though it's risky due to Mewtwo's low HP.

Groudon's high HP and defense mean it will take time to wear down, but with Cradily's Suction Cups, it can stay in and apply pressure. Keep an eye on Groudon's HP and consider switching in a faster Pokémon if it becomes weakened or frozen.\n\nSwitched in Mewtwo to use Ice Beam on Groudon. Groudon's high HP and defense mean it may not be frozen immediately, but if it is, it would be a good opportunity to gain momentum.

Need to watch for Groudon's Earthquake and consider switching out if needed. Mewtwo's Pressure ability will help wear down Groudon over time.\n\nMewtwo's Ice Beam has a chance to freeze Groudon, which is currently at low HP. If successful, Groudon will be locked down, giving an advantage. If not, consider switching to Tyranitar to handle Groudon's Earthquake. Groudon's Earthquake is super effective against Mewtwo, so need to be cautious. Mewtwo's Pressure ability can help wear down Groudon over time. Opponent may try to switch out Groudon if frozen, so need to be ready for that. Keep an eye on Groudon's HP and status to adjust strategy accordingly.\n\nOpponent's Starmie is a Water/Fairy type, making it weak to Thunder.

Tyranitar's Rock Slide is a strong physical move that could break through Aerodactyl's defenses. Mewtwo is at very low HP and may not survive long if switched in. The opponent's team includes Groudon and Starmie, with Groudon being a physical wall and Starmie being weak to Thunder. If Aerodactyl is not taken down, the opponent may switch to Groudon or Starmie. Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability is causing the sandstorm, which may help it survive longer. Need to consider switching to Mewtwo if Aerodactyl is not a threat anymore, but Mewtwo's low HP makes it risky. Groudon's high HP and defense make it a tough opponent. Starmie's weakness to Thunder is a key point to consider for future turns.\n\nSwitched in Mewtwo to take over from Tyranitar, which was at 3.22% HP.

Since the only available move is Dragon Dance, it will continue to use it, but the boost is already at maximum (6). This means the Encore is effectively a trap, and Tyranitar will not be able to act meaningfully. The opponent's Wynaut is alive and using Encore, so switching out is not an option. The sandstorm is ongoing, and Tyranitar's Sand Stream ability is active, which helps it survive the sandstorm. However, with only 3.22% HP left, Tyranitar is likely to faint on the next turn unless something changes. The opponent's team includes Groudon and Starmie, with Groudon being a physical wall and Starmie being weak to Thunder. Mewtwo is still alive at 2.83% HP, but it is not active. The only viable option is to switch in Mewtwo to handle the remaining opponents. Mewtwo's Thunder is super effective against Starmie, and Ice Beam has a chance to freeze Groudon. However, Mewtwo's low HP makes it risky. If Mewtwo is switched in, it should immediately use Thunder on Starmie to take it down, then use Ice Beam on Groudon. If Groudon is frozen, it can be locked down for an easy win. If Starmie is hit with Thunder, it will take significant damage. The goal is to eliminate Starmie first, then focus on Groudon.

Tyranitar is under the Encore effect and at 3.22% HP, which means it will likely faint soon. Mewtwo is the only other active Pokémon but is also at 2.83% HP, which is extremely low. The opponent's active Pokémon is Wynaut, which has a 40% HP remaining and is using Counter. The sandstorm is ongoing, which is beneficial for Tyranitar due to its Sand Stream ability, but it's also causing damage to Wynaut. The opponent's team includes Groudon and Starmie, with Groudon being a physical wall and Starmie being weak to Thunder. Mewtwo's Pressure ability can help wear down the opponent's team over time, but with its low HP, it's risky to keep it in. The key is to use Mewtwo's Thunder on Starmie and Ice Beam on Groudon, but with the low HP of Mewtwo, it's crucial to be ready to switch out if needed. However, since Tyranitar is under Encore and will likely faint, the immediate action is to switch in Mewtwo to handle the remaining threats. If Mewtwo is unable to survive, the battle may be lost. The best move at this point is to switch in Mewtwo to use Thunder on Starmie and Ice Beam on Groudon, but with the low HP, it's a high-risk move.
