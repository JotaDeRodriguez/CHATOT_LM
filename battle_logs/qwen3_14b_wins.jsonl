If Shiftry is paralyzed, it will be easier to switch out and Blissey can take more damage.\n\nSwitched in Gyarados to take advantage of the type matchup against Shiftry. Gyarados has Dragondance to boost its stats and can deal more damage. Shiftry has Explosion, which is a threat, but Gyarados can handle it with its high Defense and Special Defense stats.\n\nGyarados used Dragondance to boost its Attack and Speed. Now it can set up for Earthquake. Metagross has Pursuit, so Gyarados needs to be careful when switching out. Groudon is a strong backup if Metagross resists Earthquake. Blissey is out, so Gyarados needs to handle Metagross directly.\n\nSwitched in Groudon to handle Metagross and set up a sun field. Groudon's Drought ability will activate, creating a sun field which boosts Fire-type moves. Groudon can use Overheat to deal significant damage to Metagross. If Groudon is forced to switch out, Metagross is a threat with Explosion, so it's important to be cautious. Groudon's typing is Ground, which is weak to Water and Grass-type moves, so be mindful of the opponent's potential switches.\n\nGroudon used Earthquake on Snorlax, dealing heavy damage. If Snorlax is knocked out, the next Pokémon will be Shiftry, which is weak to Fire-type moves. Groudon's Overheat can be used effectively against Shiftry. If Snorlax is not knocked out, Groudon can continue to apply pressure with Earthquake or use Overheat if the opponent switches out. Need to be cautious of Snorlax's potential moves and status effects.\n\nUsed Overheat to take advantage of the sun boost against Clefable. Clefable is weak to Fire-type moves, so this is an effective strategy. If Clefable is knocked out, the next Pokémon will be either Shiftry or Metagross, both of which are weak to Fire-type moves. Groudon can continue to apply pressure with Overheat or Earthquake. If Clefable resists or survives, Groudon can use Earthquake next turn.\n\nGroudon used Swords Dance to boost its Attack, increasing the power of its next physical moves. Clefable has Meteor Mash, which is super effective, but Groudon is now more dangerous with boosted Attack. Next turn, Groudon can use Earthquake to hit Clefable again or switch to Metagross if needed. Need to be cautious of Clefable's potential moves and status effects. If Clefable switches out, the next Pokémon will be Shiftry or Metagross, both weak to Ground-type moves."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Groudon has already set up with Swords Dance and is under a super effective Meteor Mash attack, but is still in a good position with 77.97% HP.

The next logical step is to use Earthquake to hit Clefable, which is weak to Ground-type moves. Since Groudon has already set up and is in a good position, it's best to capitalize on the setup and deal damage to Clefable.

Groudon is also an option, but Gyarados might be more effective in this situation. Need to consider the opponent's potential moves and prepare for a sweep.\n\nGyarados used Dragon Dance to boost its Attack and Speed, setting up for a sweep. Metagross's Earthquake is a threat, but Gyarados's Intimidate lowers Metagross's Attack. Gyarados's next move could be Hiddenpower or Earthquake to take down Metagross.

This gives Blissey an advantage in the next turn. Shiftry's likely moves are physical attacks, so Blissey should use Thunderwave to paralyze it.

Pursuit is a good move here because it has priority and can hit the opponent's Metagross as it switches out. If the opponent's Metagross switches out, I can use Pursuit to deal damage.

The opponent's Aerodactyl used Double-Edge, which was resisted by Tyranitar, dealing 264/342 HP damage. Aerodactyl is still active and has high HP (100%) and has Double-Edge as a move. The opponent's team includes Groudon and Starmie, which are both still active. My team has Mewtwo at 2.83% HP, which is very low, and Tyranitar is the only active Pokémon. The opponent's Aerodactyl is likely a physical attacker, and with its high HP, it may be a wallbreaker or a setup sweeper. My Tyranitar has Dragondance, Rockslide, Earthquake, and HiddenPowerDark as available moves. Switching in Mewtwo is an option, but Mewtwo is at very low HP and may not last long. My Tyranitar has high Attack and Speed, making it a good candidate for a setup sweeper. Since Aerodactyl is a physical attacker, using Earthquake could be effective, as it's super effective against Flying types. Alternatively, Rockslide could also be a good move, as it's a physical move with a chance to hit multiple times. However, considering the sandstorm is active, and Tyranitar has Sand Stream, it's important to consider the weather's effect on moves. Earthquake is super effective against Aerodactyl and can help break through its defenses.

The opponent's Aerodactyl used Double-Edge, which was resisted by Tyranitar. Tyranitar then used Earthquake, but Aerodactyl is immune to it. The opponent's Aerodactyl is a physical attacker with high HP, likely a wallbreaker or setup sweeper. Tyranitar's Earthquake was ineffective, so we need to find another way to deal with Aerodactyl. Tyranitar's Dragon Dance can boost its stats for a sweep, but Aerodactyl's high HP may require more damage. Switching in Mewtwo could be an option, but Mewtwo is at very low HP (2.83%) and may not survive long. The opponent's team includes Groudon and Starmie, with Groudon being a physical wall and Starmie being weak to Thunder. If Aerodactyl is not taken down, the opponent may switch to Groudon or Starmie. Tyranitar's Rock Slide could be effective against Aerodactyl, as it's a Rock-type move. Alternatively, Hidden Power Dark could be used if Aerodactyl has a weakness to it. Since Aerodactyl is immune to Earthquake, switching to a different move or Pokémon may be necessary. Tyranitar's current HP is 28.36%, so it's in a dangerous position. If Aerodactyl continues to attack, Tyranitar may be forced to switch out. Mewtwo's Thunder is super effective against Starmie, but switching in Mewtwo now may not be ideal due to its low HP. The best option may be to use a move that can deal significant damage to Aerodactyl or switch to Mewtwo if Aerodactyl is not a threat anymore. However, Mewtwo's low HP makes it a risky choice. If Aerodactyl is not taken down, the opponent may switch to Groudon, which is a tough opponent. Tyranitar's Rock Slide is a strong physical move that could break through Aerodactyl's defenses. Considering the sandstorm's effect, Tyranitar's Sandstream ability may help it survive longer.

Mewtwo is the only other active Pokémon on my team and is at 2.83% HP, which is also very low. The opponent's active Pokémon is Wynaut, which has the Shadow Tag ability and is using Encore. Since Wynaut has Shadow Tag, it will prevent me from switching out, which is a significant problem because my current Pokémon are both at very low HP and will likely faint. However, I need to make the best move possible with the current situation. The available move for Tyranitar is Dragon Dance, which boosts its Attack and Speed. However, since Tyranitar is under Encore, it cannot use any other move besides the one that was Encore'd, which in this case is Dragon Dance. Therefore, I must use Dragon Dance. This will increase Tyranitar's Attack and Speed, which might help it survive a bit longer and potentially set up for a sweep if it can break free from Encore. However, since Wynaut has Shadow Tag, I cannot switch out, so I need to try to use Dragon Dance to boost my stats and possibly outspeed the opponent's next move. If I can boost my stats enough, I might be able to survive and take down Wynaut. If not, I will likely faint, but I have no other options. This is a risky move, but it's the only one available. I need to try to use Dragon Dance to increase my chances of surviving and potentially taking down Wynaut before I faint.", "action": "dragondance"}, "outcome": "win", "is_valid_response": true}

Since Celebi is already fainted, the next logical step is to switch in a healthy Pokémon to continue the battle. The available switches are Lapras and Nidoking. Considering the opponent's Muk has 51% HP and is likely to be a strong threat, I need to choose a Pokémon that can handle this effectively. Lapras has Water/Ice typing, which is weak to Electric and Fighting moves, but it has Water Absorb and Leftovers for recovery. Nidoking has Poison/Ground typing, which is weak to Ground and Psychic moves, but it has Choice Band for high offensive power. Given that Muk is a Poison-type, Nidoking's Ground-type moves would be super effective. However, since Celebi's last move was Psychic, which is super effective against Muk, it's possible that the opponent is expecting a switch-in that can handle that. Lapras, with its Water Absorb, can handle Water moves, but Muk's main moves are Sludge Bomb, which is a Poison-type move. Nidoking's Choice Band and high Attack stat make it a strong candidate for finishing off Muk quickly. However, since Nidoking is a Poison/Ground type, it's weak to Psychic and Ground moves. Considering the opponent's previous Pokémon (Clefable) was weak to Psychic, and the scratchpad notes mention that Celebi's Psychic is super effective, it's likely that the opponent is expecting a Psychic-type move. Therefore, switching in Lapras, which is not weak to Psychic, would be a safer choice. Lapras can use Thunderbolt to deal with Muk, and with Leftovers, it can recover HP. This would allow for a more sustainable approach against Muk. However, Nidoking's high Attack and Choice Band could allow for a quick KO of Muk. Given that Muk is at 51% HP, a powerful move from Nidoking could finish it off, but if it switches out, Lapras would be better prepared. Since the scratchpad notes mention that Starmie's Thunderbolt could finish Gengar, and Lapras has Thunderbolt, it's possible that Lapras is the better choice here.
