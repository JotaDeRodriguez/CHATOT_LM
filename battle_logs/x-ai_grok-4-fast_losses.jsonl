likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Metagross is Choice Band-locked into Earthquake, which deals neutral damage to Deoxys-Defense (~40% chip based on previous hit) but won't KO it quickly, especially with Recover likely on its defensive set. Deoxys-D has very low offenses (base 30 Atk / 90 SpA), so switching Rayquaza in is low-risk; it can easily tank any move like Night Shade, Toxic, or Recover. This breaks the lock, positions Rayquaza (faster than Deoxys-D) to Extreme Speed next turn for a strong neutral hit (CB-boosted, predicts KO at 63% HP or heavy damage), or to pivot if opponent switches their last mon. Rain has 7 turns left but ends post-turn; Rayquaza's Air Lock isn't active yet but will neutralize on switch-in if needed. Opponent's last mon unknown but Rayquaza's coverage (ES priority, Rock Slide for Ghosts/Flying, EQ for Grounds, HP likely Fighting/Ice) covers common Ubers threats like Gengar or Snorlax.

likely Wobbuffet line trapper.

Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent's Deoxys-Defense is at full HP after Recover and is likely a defensive set with status moves like Toxic or Spikes, using Pressure to drain PP. As Rayquaza's last viable mon with Choice Band, I must select a move carefully since it locks me in. Deoxys-D (Psychic) is weak to Dark, making Hidden Power Dark super effective and the strongest option to chunk or KO it, outperforming neutral moves like Rock Slide, Earthquake, or Extreme Speed. Rayquaza outspeeds (base 95 vs. 90), ensuring I move first. If it survives, I'm locked into a super effective move, which remains advantageous against this matchup. No opponent switches expected as this appears to be their last mon based on prior KOs (Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily, and others implied). Goal is to secure the KO and win the battle.", "action": "hiddenpowerdark", "scratchpad": "Deoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage.

Deoxys outspeeds Rayquaza (evident from log where Deoxys moved first in turns 9-10) and has Pressure (doubles PP usage on moves targeting it) and Leftovers. Staying in risks Deoxys using Recover (50% heal, self-target so no PP penalty from Pressure) after or instead of Seismic Toss, netting positive HP for Deoxys (~+23% per turn if Recover after chip) while draining my Hidden Power PP (15 base, effectively ~7 uses under Pressure). This leads to a stall disadvantage, as Deoxys can maintain health and potentially Seismic Toss (Normal, fixed 100 damage, PP doubled under Pressure so limited uses ~5 effective) to chip Rayquaza to ~27% without me KOing it soon. Switching to Metagross breaks the Choice lock on Rayquaza, preserving its flexibility (e.g., Extreme Speed priority later). Metagross (full HP, Choice Band, Clear Body) will likely tank a predicted Seismic Toss (100 damage, neutral Normal on Steel/Psychic, to ~70% HP) since Deoxys has been aggressively using ST on Rayquaza. If Deoxys Recovers instead, it heals to full but faces no immediate threat this turn.

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Metagross is Choice Band and freshly switched in, so no lock; can select Meteor Mash. Deoxys-D is defensive form (Pressure, Leftovers, Recover, Seismic Toss confirmed), weak to Steel (2x SE). CB Meteor Mash (base 120, STAB 1.5x, SE 2x, Atk 405) should OHKO Deoxys-D's low base HP (50), even with high Def/Spe EVs. Opponent's Seismic Toss does fixed 100 damage, which Metagross (333 HP) easily survives. Earthquake is also SE but weaker (base 100 vs 120). Avoid Explosion sac unless necessary. Post-KO, opponent sends last mon (likely Gengar spinblock/Tbolt or Snorlax tank/Curse); Rayquaza at 52% can pivot in for ES priority cleanup if favorable matchup, or Metagross follows up with lock if needed (e.g., EQ vs Snorlax 2x).

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Metagross is locked into Meteor Mash due to Choice Band from the previous turn. This move is super effective against Deoxys-Defense (Psychic-type) and, with Choice Band and +1 Attack boost, it will easily OHKO Deoxys even if it uses Recover first (assuming Deoxys is faster based on prior turn order). Switching to Rayquaza would allow Deoxys to Recover to full or Seismic Toss for fixed 100 damage, losing momentum. Prioritizing the KO secures the advantage; post-KO, Meteor Mash remains strong against predicted switches like low-HP Kyogre (neutral but high power) or Cradily (super effective on Rock). Rayquaza waits on bench for Extreme Speed cleanup against the final threats.", "action": "meteormash", "scratchpad": "Turn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked).

Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch.

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Metagross is Choice Band-locked into Meteor Mash from previous turns. This move is super effective against Deoxys (Psychic-type) and, with the +1 Attack boost, should OHKO Deoxys from 95% HP, as the previous unboosted hit dealt approximately 67% damage. Deoxys likely outspeeds our Metagross (based on prior turn order against Rayquaza) and may use Recover or Seismic Toss. Seismic Toss deals fixed 100 damage, reducing Metagross to about 40% HP but not KOing it (current 70% HP). Even if Deoxys Recovers to full, Meteor Mash still secures the OHKO. Switching is impossible due to Choice lock, so Meteor Mash is the only viable action. This KO removes a key defensive pivot and sets up momentum against the opponent's low-HP bench (Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%).", "action": "meteormash", "scratchpad": "Deoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked.

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Metagross is locked into Meteor Mash due to Choice Band. At +1 Atk, CB Meteor Mash is calculated to OHKO Deoxys-Defense from full HP, as the previous +0 hit did ~67% damage, and +1 boosts it sufficiently for 100%. Deoxys will likely Recover or Seismic Toss first, but Seismic Toss only does fixed 100 damage, leaving Metagross at ~40% HP, which it can survive. Even if it misses (10% chance, despite recent misses being independent), we can retry next turn. Switching to Rayquaza risks Deoxys Seismic Tossing it to low HP (~27%), and Rayquaza's HP (SE) only chips ~25%, allowing Deoxys to Recover and stall further. Staying in maximizes the 90% chance to KO and chain into opponent's weakened bench (low-HP Kyogre/Cradily, likely next switches).

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation.

Our Metagross is locked into Meteor Mash due to Choice Band from the previous turn, making it the only move available without switching.

After the KO, we'll be locked into Meteor Mash against whatever they send next—strong (2x SE) against Cradily (Rock/Grass), neutral against potential threats like Gengar or Snorlax, but resisted (0.5x) by Kyogre (Water).

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation. Win con: KO Deoxys, Metagross chains weakened bench, Ray ES closes.\n\nCurrent opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle, likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), one unknown (predict Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-Deoxys KO, locked Meteor Mash: 2x SE vs Cradily (~OHKO from 53%), 0.5x resisted vs Kyogre (low ~20-30% chip), neutral vs Gengar/Snorlax (~40-50%). If they send Kyogre, low damage allows pressure but risk of Water Spout revenge; sac Metagross via Explosion next if needed for spread damage. Rayquaza 52% ES priority ready for cleanup vs low-HP final two; Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide coverage. Hazards likely present (Stealth Rock from Cradily); Air Lock ends rain if Rayquaza switches in. Win con: KO Deoxys, Meteor Mash Cradily if switched for chain, pivot/switch Rayquaza ES vs Kyogre/unknown; Explosion momentum if locked poorly."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Metagross is locked into Meteor Mash, which deals resisted but still substantial damage (~30% chip) to Kyogre due to Choice Band and +1 Attack boost, reducing it from 56% to approximately 26%. Kyogre is likely Choice-locked into Thunder from prior uses, which would OHKO our low-HP Metagross (super effective). Sacrificing Metagross here provides valuable chip damage without risking our healthier Rayquaza. Next turn, we can switch in Rayquaza (full speed advantage assuming no Scarf on Kyogre) to use priority Extreme Speed to KO the weakened Kyogre before it can act, preserving Rayquaza's HP for the remaining opponent threats (opponent's Rayquaza at 52%, Cradily at ~53%, and one unknown). Switching Rayquaza now would force it to take a neutral Thunder hit (~40-60% damage), leaving it too low (~0-20% remaining) to reliably sweep the backline.

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation. Win con: KO Deoxys, Metagross chains weakened bench, Ray ES closes.\n\nCurrent opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle, likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), one unknown (predict Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-Deoxys KO, locked Meteor Mash: 2x SE vs Cradily (~OHKO from 53%), 0.5x resisted vs Kyogre (low ~20-30% chip), neutral vs Gengar/Snorlax (~40-50%). If they send Kyogre, low damage allows pressure but risk of Water Spout revenge; sac Metagross via Explosion next if needed for spread damage. Rayquaza 52% ES priority ready for cleanup vs low-HP final two; Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide coverage. Hazards likely present (Stealth Rock from Cradily); Air Lock ends rain if Rayquaza switches in. Win con: KO Deoxys, Meteor Mash Cradily if switched for chain, pivot/switch Rayquaza ES vs Kyogre/unknown; Explosion momentum if locked poorly.\n\nKyogre chipped to ~26% via resisted Meteor Mash sac; Rayquaza next in for ES priority KO. Opponent's Rayquaza (52%, likely CB locked into Hidden Power from earlier, weak to Rock Slide/EQ); Cradily (53%, walls but weak to Steel/Steel coverage if needed earlier); unknown (Gengar weak to ? neutral ES, or Snorlax weak to ? but bulky - ES priority cleans). Post-Kyogre, predict switch to opponent's Rayquaza (Flying immune to prior EQ but ES outspeeds and chips); use Rock Slide for SE if sent in. Win con: Rayquaza ES/Outrage/Rock Slide sweeps weakened 3, coverage vs switches. Rain persists but Drizzle ends post-KO."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My active Pokémon, Metagross, has fainted, leaving only Rayquaza as the remaining viable team member. I must switch to Rayquaza to continue the battle. Opponent's Kyogre is at 56% HP with Drizzle active (rain boosting Water/Electric moves) and known moves Thunder and Surf. Rayquaza's Air Lock will end the rain upon entry, neutralizing boosts. However, Kyogre is likely faster in decision or will target with Thunder (super effective on Flying-type Rayquaza due to 2x weakness), potentially OHKOing Rayquaza at 52% HP if it's Specs-boosted. If they use Surf instead (neutral), Rayquaza may survive and outspeed for a revenge kill with Extreme Speed (priority) or Earthquake (neutral damage, potential OHKO calc ~70-90% on 56% Kyogre).

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation. Win con: KO Deoxys, Metagross chains weakened bench, Ray ES closes.\n\nCurrent opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle, likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), one unknown (predict Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-Deoxys KO, locked Meteor Mash: 2x SE vs Cradily (~OHKO from 53%), 0.5x resisted vs Kyogre (low ~20-30% chip), neutral vs Gengar/Snorlax (~40-50%). If they send Kyogre, low damage allows pressure but risk of Water Spout revenge; sac Metagross via Explosion next if needed for spread damage. Rayquaza 52% ES priority ready for cleanup vs low-HP final two; Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide coverage. Hazards likely present (Stealth Rock from Cradily); Air Lock ends rain if Rayquaza switches in. Win con: KO Deoxys, Meteor Mash Cradily if switched for chain, pivot/switch Rayquaza ES vs Kyogre/unknown; Explosion momentum if locked poorly.\n\nKyogre chipped to ~26% via resisted Meteor Mash sac; Rayquaza next in for ES priority KO. Opponent's Rayquaza (52%, likely CB locked into Hidden Power from earlier, weak to Rock Slide/EQ); Cradily (53%, walls but weak to Steel/Steel coverage if needed earlier); unknown (Gengar weak to ? neutral ES, or Snorlax weak to ? but bulky - ES priority cleans). Post-Kyogre, predict switch to opponent's Rayquaza (Flying immune to prior EQ but ES outspeeds and chips); use Rock Slide for SE if sent in. Win con: Rayquaza ES/Outrage/Rock Slide sweeps weakened 3, coverage vs switches. Rain persists but Drizzle ends post-KO.\n\nFinal stand: Rayquaza CB (52% HP, Air Lock ends rain) vs Kyogre (56%, Drizzle/Leftovers/Specs? Thunder/Surf/Water Spout?/Ice Beam/CM). Predict Thunder SE OHKO risk on switch-in; if survives (e.g., Surf neutral ~40-50% dmg), outspeed with ES priority (~50-60% chip, KO possible) or EQ neutral (~80%+ dmg, likely KO). Lock into ES for safety vs potential switches post-KO (e.g., to Cradily resist EQ 0.25x but weak to ?). Opponent remaining: Rayquaza (52%, CB HP? Rock Slide/EQ coverage), Cradily (53%, defensive Grass wall), unknown (Gengar/Snorlax). Win con low but trade Kyogre for momentum; ES chains vs weakened bench if lucky survive."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Rayquaza outspeeds Kyogre and is Choice Banded. Extreme Speed deals approximately 50-60% to a full-health Kyogre, leaving it at 2-12% HP. Even if it doesn't KO, Kyogre's retaliatory Water Spout will have very low power (3-18 base) due to its low remaining HP, dealing negligible damage in rain (though Air Lock likely negates boosts). Next turn, a locked Extreme Speed easily finishes the crippled Kyogre. Locking into Extreme Speed is ideal for priority cleanup against the opponent's remaining low-HP threats: their Rayquaza (51%, neutral ~50% damage, likely KO), Cradily (53%, neutral ~50%), and unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax, neutral chip). Earthquake would likely secure the immediate KO but locks into a move that's 0x on their Rayquaza (immune) and resisted by Cradily; a switch to their Rayquaza post-KO would result in 0 damage from me followed by a super-effective hit (Rock Slide or Hidden Power Fighting, 2x) likely KOing my 51% Rayquaza, leading to loss as no team remains. Extreme Speed ensures safe momentum and sweep potential.

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation. Win con: KO Deoxys, Metagross chains weakened bench, Ray ES closes.\n\nCurrent opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle, likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), one unknown (predict Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-Deoxys KO, locked Meteor Mash: 2x SE vs Cradily (~OHKO from 53%), 0.5x resisted vs Kyogre (low ~20-30% chip), neutral vs Gengar/Snorlax (~40-50%). If they send Kyogre, low damage allows pressure but risk of Water Spout revenge; sac Metagross via Explosion next if needed for spread damage. Rayquaza 52% ES priority ready for cleanup vs low-HP final two; Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide coverage. Hazards likely present (Stealth Rock from Cradily); Air Lock ends rain if Rayquaza switches in. Win con: KO Deoxys, Meteor Mash Cradily if switched for chain, pivot/switch Rayquaza ES vs Kyogre/unknown; Explosion momentum if locked poorly.\n\nKyogre chipped to ~26% via resisted Meteor Mash sac; Rayquaza next in for ES priority KO. Opponent's Rayquaza (52%, likely CB locked into Hidden Power from earlier, weak to Rock Slide/EQ); Cradily (53%, walls but weak to Steel/Steel coverage if needed earlier); unknown (Gengar weak to ? neutral ES, or Snorlax weak to ? but bulky - ES priority cleans). Post-Kyogre, predict switch to opponent's Rayquaza (Flying immune to prior EQ but ES outspeeds and chips); use Rock Slide for SE if sent in. Win con: Rayquaza ES/Outrage/Rock Slide sweeps weakened 3, coverage vs switches. Rain persists but Drizzle ends post-KO.\n\nFinal stand: Rayquaza CB (52% HP, Air Lock ends rain) vs Kyogre (56%, Drizzle/Leftovers/Specs? Thunder/Surf/Water Spout?/Ice Beam/CM). Predict Thunder SE OHKO risk on switch-in; if survives (e.g., Surf neutral ~40-50% dmg), outspeed with ES priority (~50-60% chip, KO possible) or EQ neutral (~80%+ dmg, likely KO). Lock into ES for safety vs potential switches post-KO (e.g., to Cradily resist EQ 0.25x but weak to ?). Opponent remaining: Rayquaza (52%, CB HP? Rock Slide/EQ coverage), Cradily (53%, defensive Grass wall), unknown (Gengar/Snorlax). Win con low but trade Kyogre for momentum; ES chains vs weakened bench if lucky survive.\n\nLocked into Extreme Speed post-this turn: perfect for priority KO/chip on opponent's Rayquaza (51%, CB, resets lock on switch-in, moves: likely HP Fighting/Rock Slide/EQ/ES; predict Rock Slide 2x revenge), Cradily (53%, defensive Suction Cups/Leftovers, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock; ES neutral ~50%), unknown (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock weak to ? neutral ES or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank neutral ~40-50%). Kyogre down next turn at latest with minimal risk; then ES sweeps 3 low-HP remains for win. No hazards mitigation needed with priority.

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation. Win con: KO Deoxys, Metagross chains weakened bench, Ray ES closes.\n\nCurrent opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle, likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), one unknown (predict Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-Deoxys KO, locked Meteor Mash: 2x SE vs Cradily (~OHKO from 53%), 0.5x resisted vs Kyogre (low ~20-30% chip), neutral vs Gengar/Snorlax (~40-50%). If they send Kyogre, low damage allows pressure but risk of Water Spout revenge; sac Metagross via Explosion next if needed for spread damage. Rayquaza 52% ES priority ready for cleanup vs low-HP final two; Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide coverage. Hazards likely present (Stealth Rock from Cradily); Air Lock ends rain if Rayquaza switches in. Win con: KO Deoxys, Meteor Mash Cradily if switched for chain, pivot/switch Rayquaza ES vs Kyogre/unknown; Explosion momentum if locked poorly.\n\nKyogre chipped to ~26% via resisted Meteor Mash sac; Rayquaza next in for ES priority KO. Opponent's Rayquaza (52%, likely CB locked into Hidden Power from earlier, weak to Rock Slide/EQ); Cradily (53%, walls but weak to Steel/Steel coverage if needed earlier); unknown (Gengar weak to ? neutral ES, or Snorlax weak to ? but bulky - ES priority cleans). Post-Kyogre, predict switch to opponent's Rayquaza (Flying immune to prior EQ but ES outspeeds and chips); use Rock Slide for SE if sent in. Win con: Rayquaza ES/Outrage/Rock Slide sweeps weakened 3, coverage vs switches. Rain persists but Drizzle ends post-KO.\n\nFinal stand: Rayquaza CB (52% HP, Air Lock ends rain) vs Kyogre (56%, Drizzle/Leftovers/Specs? Thunder/Surf/Water Spout?/Ice Beam/CM). Predict Thunder SE OHKO risk on switch-in; if survives (e.g., Surf neutral ~40-50% dmg), outspeed with ES priority (~50-60% chip, KO possible) or EQ neutral (~80%+ dmg, likely KO). Lock into ES for safety vs potential switches post-KO (e.g., to Cradily resist EQ 0.25x but weak to ?). Opponent remaining: Rayquaza (52%, CB HP? Rock Slide/EQ coverage), Cradily (53%, defensive Grass wall), unknown (Gengar/Snorlax). Win con low but trade Kyogre for momentum; ES chains vs weakened bench if lucky survive.\n\nLocked into Extreme Speed post-this turn: perfect for priority KO/chip on opponent's Rayquaza (51%, CB, resets lock on switch-in, moves: likely HP Fighting/Rock Slide/EQ/ES; predict Rock Slide 2x revenge), Cradily (53%, defensive Suction Cups/Leftovers, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock; ES neutral ~50%), unknown (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock weak to ? neutral ES or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank neutral ~40-50%). Kyogre down next turn at latest with minimal risk; then ES sweeps 3 low-HP remains for win. No hazards mitigation needed with priority. Air Lock active, weather neutralized.\n\nKyogre KO via ES priority; locked ES perfect for chain vs final 2-3 low-HP threats (opponent Rayquaza ~24% neutral chip ~50%+, Cradily ~53% neutral ~40-50%, unknown Gengar/Snorlax ~40-50%).

As my last active Pokémon with multiple opponent fainted (Wynaut, Kyogre, Deoxys-D, and possibly others), this pressures the remaining threats (Cradily and any unrevealed last mon like Gengar or Snorlax).

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation. Win con: KO Deoxys, Metagross chains weakened bench, Ray ES closes.\n\nCurrent opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle, likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), one unknown (predict Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-Deoxys KO, locked Meteor Mash: 2x SE vs Cradily (~OHKO from 53%), 0.5x resisted vs Kyogre (low ~20-30% chip), neutral vs Gengar/Snorlax (~40-50%). If they send Kyogre, low damage allows pressure but risk of Water Spout revenge; sac Metagross via Explosion next if needed for spread damage. Rayquaza 52% ES priority ready for cleanup vs low-HP final two; Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide coverage. Hazards likely present (Stealth Rock from Cradily); Air Lock ends rain if Rayquaza switches in. Win con: KO Deoxys, Meteor Mash Cradily if switched for chain, pivot/switch Rayquaza ES vs Kyogre/unknown; Explosion momentum if locked poorly.\n\nKyogre chipped to ~26% via resisted Meteor Mash sac; Rayquaza next in for ES priority KO. Opponent's Rayquaza (52%, likely CB locked into Hidden Power from earlier, weak to Rock Slide/EQ); Cradily (53%, walls but weak to Steel/Steel coverage if needed earlier); unknown (Gengar weak to ? neutral ES, or Snorlax weak to ? but bulky - ES priority cleans). Post-Kyogre, predict switch to opponent's Rayquaza (Flying immune to prior EQ but ES outspeeds and chips); use Rock Slide for SE if sent in. Win con: Rayquaza ES/Outrage/Rock Slide sweeps weakened 3, coverage vs switches. Rain persists but Drizzle ends post-KO.\n\nFinal stand: Rayquaza CB (52% HP, Air Lock ends rain) vs Kyogre (56%, Drizzle/Leftovers/Specs? Thunder/Surf/Water Spout?/Ice Beam/CM). Predict Thunder SE OHKO risk on switch-in; if survives (e.g., Surf neutral ~40-50% dmg), outspeed with ES priority (~50-60% chip, KO possible) or EQ neutral (~80%+ dmg, likely KO). Lock into ES for safety vs potential switches post-KO (e.g., to Cradily resist EQ 0.25x but weak to ?). Opponent remaining: Rayquaza (52%, CB HP? Rock Slide/EQ coverage), Cradily (53%, defensive Grass wall), unknown (Gengar/Snorlax). Win con low but trade Kyogre for momentum; ES chains vs weakened bench if lucky survive.\n\nLocked into Extreme Speed post-this turn: perfect for priority KO/chip on opponent's Rayquaza (51%, CB, resets lock on switch-in, moves: likely HP Fighting/Rock Slide/EQ/ES; predict Rock Slide 2x revenge), Cradily (53%, defensive Suction Cups/Leftovers, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock; ES neutral ~50%), unknown (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock weak to ? neutral ES or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank neutral ~40-50%). Kyogre down next turn at latest with minimal risk; then ES sweeps 3 low-HP remains for win. No hazards mitigation needed with priority. Air Lock active, weather neutralized.\n\nKyogre KO via ES priority; locked ES perfect for chain vs final 2-3 low-HP threats (opponent Rayquaza ~24% neutral chip ~50%+, Cradily ~53% neutral ~40-50%, unknown Gengar/Snorlax ~40-50%). Predict switch to bulky last mon (Snorlax tank or Gengar support); ES pressures without risk. No hazards concern with momentum. Battle ends this turn or next with sweep.\n\nCradily defensive (Suction Cups/Leftovers, ~60% HP, likely Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock); ES priority chips ~40-50%, aim KO or force low-HP revenge. Opponent remaining: Cradily +1 unknown (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock neutral ES ~40-50%, or Snorlax tank neutral ~40%); ES locked perfect for priority sweep vs finals.

This chips Cradily from 41% to ~23%, preventing a full recovery if they use Recover, but Cradily's Leftovers and potential recovery will likely outpace our low HP (18%) and increasing Toxic damage (~6% this turn, then more).

likely Wobbuffet line trapper. Trap active until KO. Post-KO, expect switch to anti-Bug like Steel/Poison/Flying. Track opponent team reveals. Heracross role: Wallbreaker with Guts potential if statused. Preserve CB users for late-game sweeps. Lapras as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent reveals Kyogre (Drizzle, likely Water Spout/Hydro Pump/Thunder/Ice Beam set). Expect rain boosts and possible Choice item. Lapras absorbs Water, threaten with Tbolt/Ice Beam. Heracross preserved as Guts wallbreaker for later. Track if opponent has anti-Water like Grass/Dragon switch-ins next.\n\nLapras Rest plan successful if Thunder baited; prepare Sleep Talk next for chip damage. Monitor Kyogre's response to confirm set (likely Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam). If water used, Lapras full and ready to pivot out after sleep. Preserve Rayquaza/Metagross for post-rain sweeps; Heracross as backup Guts breaker. Opponent may switch anti-Water like Rayquaza or Deoxys next if Lapras survives.\n\nLapras KO'd by Kyogre (likely Water Spout/Thunder). Heracross switching in to outspeed and chip with Megahorn; if survives, consider SD if Kyogre weak. Opponent Kyogre set confirmed: Drizzle, Thunder; predict Water Spout (rain-boosted, power scales with HP), Ice Beam, Calm Mind. Watch for opponent switch to anti-Bug (e.g., Rayquaza, Deoxys). Team momentum: Heracross Guts potential post-status; save CB Metagross/Rayquaza for post-rain sweeps or vs. setup. Opponent team: Wynaut FNT (trapper line), Kyogre active; expect Deoxys, Gengar, or another legend next.\n\nKyogre likely Choice-locked into Thunder (used twice); sets confirmed as Drizzle with Thunder, probably Specs/Water Spout but locked now. Heracross Megahorn chips safely (neutral Electric tank). Track damage: aim 40%+ chip. Opponent switch prediction: if anti-Bug (e.g., opponent's Rayquaza resists Bug 0.5x, immune Ground), pivot to Metagross (Steel absorbs Electric/Water neutral). Preserve CB Rayquaza for post-rain anti-setup (Air Lock cancels weather). Win con: Weaken Kyogre, sac Heracross if needed for Guts activation later vs. weakened foes; sweep with CB duo.\n\nHeracross Guts active (PAR); Megahorn aims for Kyogre KO, confirming lock into Thunder. Post-KO, expect opponent switch to Deoxys/Rayquaza/Gengar/Clamperl line or another Water resist. Preserve CB Metagross/Rayquaza for sweeps vs. predicted anti-rain leads. If Heracross faints to Thunder (25% paralysis fail risk), sac for momentum; next switch Rayquaza to absorb potential Ice/Thunder. Track opponent reveals: Likely Ubers core (Deoxys-A/D, Rayquaza, Gengar, Snorlax). Win con: KO Kyogre, pivot to CB breakers post-rain.\n\nHeracross FNT to Thunder (133 prior + this turn). Kyogre locked Thunder, 44% HP. Metagross switch-in tanks, sets up Meteor Mash KO next. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Kyogre (Drizzle/Choice Thunder, likely Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM) low. Predict opponent switch post-KO to Deoxys-A (fast scarfer), Rayquaza (CB DD), Gengar (Spin/Tbolt), or Snorlax (tank). Win con: KO Kyogre, sweep with CB Metagross vs. weakened team, Rayquaza Extreme Speed clean-up. Track if opponent has Grass/Dragon switch-ins for rain abuse.\n\nKyogre KO'd this turn via EQ; locked Thunder confirmed, set likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM. Opponent reveals: Wynaut (trapper) FNT, Heracross/Lapras FNT, Kyogre FNT. Predict switch to Deoxys (fast offense), Rayquaza (mixed), Gengar (spin/support), or Snorlax (tank). CB Metagross locked EQ post-move: strong vs Electric/Ground-weak foes like Rayquaza (4x), Deoxys (2x), but walled by Flying/Levitate. If opponent switches Flying immune to EQ (e.g., Rayquaza), pivot or Explosion sac if low. Win con: Metagross EQ chain vs predicted switches, Rayquaza Extreme Speed priority cleanup vs weakened team. Track for Grass/Dragon resists to rain (though Drizzle ends post-KO).\n\nOpponent reveals Cradily (Suction Cups, Leftovers, defensive Grass/Rock likely with Recover/Ingrain/Stealth Rock/Giga Drain to wall Waters/Grounds/Electrics). KO'd this turn via CB EQ. Opponent team: Wynaut, Kyogre, Cradily FNT; one last mon remaining - predict Rayquaza (mixed CB/DD), Deoxys-A (Choice Scarf offense), Gengar (Spinblock/Tbolt), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank), or Clamperl line (Shell Smash). Post-KO, Metagross locked EQ: strong vs Ground-weak last mon (e.g., Snorlax 2x, Deoxys 2x), but useless vs Flying/Levitate/Ghost (Rayquaza 4x weak actually, wait no: Rayquaza Dragon/Flying immune to Ground). Rayquaza Ground immune, so if they switch it, EQ does nothing - prepare to switch Rayquaza back in for Extreme Speed priority cleanup or Outrage sweep. Win con: Use CB Metagross EQ if vulnerable target, else sac/switch to CB Rayquaza for ES against weakened final foe; Air Lock ends rain for neutrality.\n\nSwitched to Rayquaza vs Deoxys-D (63%, Pressure/Leftovers, defensive Recover/Toxic/Spikes set likely); low threat in, ES priority next for KO or vs last mon. Opponent last mon: predict Gengar (Spin/Tbolt, weak to Rock), Snorlax (tank, weak to EQ but lock broken), or Rayquaza counter. Rain ends soon; Air Lock neutralizes. Win con: Rayquaza CB ES sweeps final two; Metagross backup for Explosion vs bulky last. Track opponent switch-ins for coverage.\n\nDeoxys-D defensive set confirmed (Recover, Pressure/Leftovers); weak to Dark for 2x damage. CB Rayquaza locks into HP Dark - optimal vs remaining foe. If survives (unlikely), spam drains PP via Pressure but secures type advantage. Post-KO, battle ends; Metagross as emergency switch if needed but preserve for potential overtime. Air Lock active, rain neutralized. Win imminent with this pressure.\n\nDeoxys-D locked matchup: HP Dark 2x SE, aim KO this turn (prior hit ~21%, another similar from 79% likely finishes). Pressure aids PP stall on Recover. Opponent last mon predict: Gengar (Tbolt/Spinblock, weak to ? HP Dark neutral but Ray resists Ghost), Snorlax (Curse/Toxic tank, weak to ? but bulky). Post-KO, if locked HP vs bad matchup, sac or switch Metagross for Explosion/EQ cleanup. Win con: KO Deoxys, pressure last mon with CB Ray or pivot to Metagross; battle ends 4-1.\n\nDeoxys-D set confirmed: Pressure, Leftovers, Recover/Seismic Toss (high Spe EV, outspeeds 226 Spe Rayquaza; likely Toxic/Spikes/Stealth Rock for defensive utility). Chips ~27% with HP Dark; OHKO via Metagross CB Meteor Mash next (~172 dmg). Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice Thunder/Water Spout/Ice Beam/CM/Specs likely), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Grass/Rock, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), Wynaut FNT (Shadow Tag trapper); two unknown (predict Gengar spinblock/Tbolt, Snorlax tank/Curse/Toxic). Rayquaza lock broken for ES/Outrage vs low-HP/Dragon-weak foes. Win con: Metagross CB Meteor Mash chain KOs Deoxys/Kyogre/Cradily, pivot Rayquaza ES cleanup vs final two; Explosion sac if walled. Watch scarfers (Deoxys-A?), setup (CM Kyogre, Curse Lax), hazards from Cradily/Gengar.\n\nTurn 12: Metagross fresh, no Choice lock. Deoxys-D full HP OHKO via CB Meteor Mash. Opponent final mon: Unrevealed, predict Gengar (Ghost/Poison, Tbolt/Spin, neutral to Steel/Rock, weak to ? but resists Ground) or Snorlax (Normal, Curse/Toxic tank, 2x Ground weak). Post-KO, lock into Meteor Mash: Strong vs ? (e.g., Gengar neutral Steel, Snorlax neutral). Rayquaza 52% ready for ES vs low-HP final; Air Lock for weather control if needed, but rain ending soon. Prioritize KO, then assess switch vs last threat for clean sweep.\n\nTurn 13: Deoxys-D KO'd via +1 CB Meteor Mash (locked). Opponent remaining: Kyogre ~50% (Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, Drizzle ends post-death if active), Cradily ~53% (defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock), unknown last mon (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: vs Kyogre neutral high dmg (~70-80% from 50%), vs Cradily 2x SE on Rock (~OHKO), vs Gengar neutral (~50%), vs Snorlax neutral (~40%). If bad switch (e.g., Gengar resists? neutral), sac Metagross via Explosion for momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES priority sweeps weakened final two; Air Lock ready if rain revives via Kyogre switch. Hazards likely from Cradily/Gengar - no spinner, but Deoxys pressure stalled some PP. Win con: Meteor Mash chain KOs Kyogre/Cradily if switched, Rayquaza ES vs last; Explosion if walled for 4-0.\n\nDeoxys KO via +1 CB Meteor Mash locked. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle/Choice? Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/CM, not locked since switched out), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), unknown 4th/5th? (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank; Wynaut FNT, possibly their Heracross/Lapras FNT earlier). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash (STAB Steel): vs Kyogre Water 0.5x resisted low dmg (~30-40%), vs Cradily Rock/Grass neutral 1x (~50-60%), vs Gengar Ghost/Poison neutral/resisted (~40%), vs Snorlax Normal neutral (~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., Water resist), Explosion sac for ~80-100% neutral spread to force KO/momentum. Rayquaza 52% ES (priority) cleans up low-HP remains; Outrage/Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Hazards possible (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no spinner. Win con: KO Deoxys, Explosion if needed, Rayquaza ES sweep vs weakened 3; Metagross chain if Steel-weak switch (unlikely). Air Lock on Ray ends rain permanently.\n\nDeoxys-D full HP; +1 CB Meteor Mash OHKO predicted. Opponent bench: Kyogre ~50%, Cradily ~53%, 1-2 unknown (likely Gengar/Snorlax or similar; multiple FNT already: Wynaut/Heracross/Lapras opponent's side). Post-KO lock Meteor Mash: Strong vs Kyogre (neutral ~70-80%), Cradily (SE ~OHKO), Gengar (neutral ~50%), Snorlax (neutral ~40%). If unfavorable switch (e.g., resists Steel), consider sac via future Explosion. Rayquaza 52% preserved for ES priority vs finals or Air Lock weather control. Hazards likely (Stealth Rock from Cradily); no mitigation. Win con: KO Deoxys, Metagross chains weakened bench, Ray ES closes.\n\nCurrent opponent bench: Kyogre ~50% (Drizzle, likely Choice Specs Water Spout/Thunder/Ice Beam/Calm Mind), Cradily ~53% (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock/Ingrain), one unknown (predict Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank). Post-Deoxys KO, locked Meteor Mash: 2x SE vs Cradily (~OHKO from 53%), 0.5x resisted vs Kyogre (low ~20-30% chip), neutral vs Gengar/Snorlax (~40-50%). If they send Kyogre, low damage allows pressure but risk of Water Spout revenge; sac Metagross via Explosion next if needed for spread damage. Rayquaza 52% ES priority ready for cleanup vs low-HP final two; Outrage/EQ/Rock Slide coverage. Hazards likely present (Stealth Rock from Cradily); Air Lock ends rain if Rayquaza switches in. Win con: KO Deoxys, Meteor Mash Cradily if switched for chain, pivot/switch Rayquaza ES vs Kyogre/unknown; Explosion momentum if locked poorly.\n\nKyogre chipped to ~26% via resisted Meteor Mash sac; Rayquaza next in for ES priority KO. Opponent's Rayquaza (52%, likely CB locked into Hidden Power from earlier, weak to Rock Slide/EQ); Cradily (53%, walls but weak to Steel/Steel coverage if needed earlier); unknown (Gengar weak to ? neutral ES, or Snorlax weak to ? but bulky - ES priority cleans). Post-Kyogre, predict switch to opponent's Rayquaza (Flying immune to prior EQ but ES outspeeds and chips); use Rock Slide for SE if sent in. Win con: Rayquaza ES/Outrage/Rock Slide sweeps weakened 3, coverage vs switches. Rain persists but Drizzle ends post-KO.\n\nFinal stand: Rayquaza CB (52% HP, Air Lock ends rain) vs Kyogre (56%, Drizzle/Leftovers/Specs? Thunder/Surf/Water Spout?/Ice Beam/CM). Predict Thunder SE OHKO risk on switch-in; if survives (e.g., Surf neutral ~40-50% dmg), outspeed with ES priority (~50-60% chip, KO possible) or EQ neutral (~80%+ dmg, likely KO). Lock into ES for safety vs potential switches post-KO (e.g., to Cradily resist EQ 0.25x but weak to ?). Opponent remaining: Rayquaza (52%, CB HP? Rock Slide/EQ coverage), Cradily (53%, defensive Grass wall), unknown (Gengar/Snorlax). Win con low but trade Kyogre for momentum; ES chains vs weakened bench if lucky survive.\n\nLocked into Extreme Speed post-this turn: perfect for priority KO/chip on opponent's Rayquaza (51%, CB, resets lock on switch-in, moves: likely HP Fighting/Rock Slide/EQ/ES; predict Rock Slide 2x revenge), Cradily (53%, defensive Suction Cups/Leftovers, Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock; ES neutral ~50%), unknown (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock weak to ? neutral ES or Snorlax Curse/Toxic tank neutral ~40-50%). Kyogre down next turn at latest with minimal risk; then ES sweeps 3 low-HP remains for win. No hazards mitigation needed with priority. Air Lock active, weather neutralized.\n\nKyogre KO via ES priority; locked ES perfect for chain vs final 2-3 low-HP threats (opponent Rayquaza ~24% neutral chip ~50%+, Cradily ~53% neutral ~40-50%, unknown Gengar/Snorlax ~40-50%). Predict switch to bulky last mon (Snorlax tank or Gengar support); ES pressures without risk. No hazards concern with momentum. Battle ends this turn or next with sweep.\n\nCradily defensive (Suction Cups/Leftovers, ~60% HP, likely Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock); ES priority chips ~40-50%, aim KO or force low-HP revenge. Opponent remaining: Cradily +1 unknown (Gengar Tbolt/Spinblock neutral ES ~40-50%, or Snorlax tank neutral ~40%); ES locked perfect for priority sweep vs finals. Rayquaza low HP (24%) - survive potential neutral hits (e.g., Giga Drain ~50-60% max) for chain KO win. No hazards mitigation needed with momentum; battle ends this/next turn.\n\nEndgame 1v1 vs Cradily (Suction Cups/Leftovers defensive: Recover/Giga Drain/Stealth Rock likely). ES resisted chip ~18%, non-lethal. Post-turn: Toxic dmg ~25 HP (to ~51/414), then upkeep LO + tox increase. Opponent recovers to ~70%+, then Grass STAB KOs us next (neutral ~50-70%+). Battle ends in loss, but we eliminated 4/5 opponent mons."}], "response": {"reasoning": "This is the endgame 1v1 with Rayquaza at critically low HP (6.28%, 26/414) badly poisoned and Choice Band-locked into Extreme Speed. Cradily is at 72% HP with Leftovers, Suction Cups (prevents phazing), and known moves Toxic and Recover; likely has a damaging move like Giga Drain or Rock Slide for coverage. Extreme Speed (Normal-type, neutral on Cradily) will chip it for approximately 18-25% damage based on prior estimates (resisted? Wait, neutral actually; CB Atk 432, power 80, neutral ~20-30% on bulky Def). I outspeed easily (Spe 226 vs base 43). However, post-move: If Cradily attacks (e.g., Giga Drain), it OHKOs my low HP. If it Recovers (heals 50% + LO/16), it outheals the chip and survives easily. Then end-of-turn: Bad poison at 3/16 (~78 HP damage) faints my Rayquaza regardless, as 26 < 78.

Shadow Ball is the optimal choice: physical Ghost move, super effective on Psychic Deoxys, boosted by Choice Band (1.5x Atk), with Shiftry's high Atk (328) likely to OHKO or heavily chunk Deoxys. Other physical options: Brick Break (neutral Fighting, weaker), Explosion (sac play, neutral Normal, but preserves no momentum as last mon). Solar Beam is special (no Band boost) and neutral.

Fragile, fast revenge killer. Jirachi tanks special Psychic hits well. Team plan: Use Jirachi as special wall/setup vs psychics, preserve for late-game CM sweep. Watch for Deoxys priority. Cradily for stall vs physical threats. Hitmontop intimidate physical attackers. Shiftry CB breaker post-setup.\n\nMetagross likely CB physical set (Meteor Mash, Earthquake, Agility). Jirachi resists Meteor Mash, can CM up. Monitor for Agility boosts. Preserve Jirachi for CM sweep vs special threats. Opponent may revenge with another fast mon.\n\nJirachi unexpectedly fainted early; adjust plan to use Hitmontop as physical pivot with Intimidate and Bulk Up potential. Monitor Metagross for Agility or Psychic moves. Save Cradily for stalling special threats or Ground-weak foes. Shiftry as late-game CB breaker once threats are chipped. Opponent remaining team unknown; predict more Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon or another Deoxys form.\n\nHitmontop vs Metagross: HJK should do ~50-70% damage based on calcs (super effective STAB physical). If Metagross survives, expect Meteor Mash next (neutral on Hitmontop, but watch for SpD drop). No Intimidate effect due to Clear Body. If Hitmontop low, switch to Cradily (resists Steel, immune? No, but tanks physical). Opponent may have Kyogre/Groudon next; Shiftry weak to water, Cradily handles ground. Long-term: Use Shiftry CB after chipping walls.\n\nTeam down to Cradily (wall/Toxic stall) and Shiftry (CB breaker/Explosion sac). Opp remaining 2 likely Ubers (Kyogre/Groudon/Rayquaza?). Prioritize Toxic on switch-ins to chip. Cradily handles physical Ubers well; switch to Shiftry if opp weakened physical wall or for super-effective CB hits. Watch for weather setters (Drought/ Drizzle). Long-term: Stall with Cradily, then Shiftry sweeps chipped foes.\n\nMewtwo (Pressure, unknown item): Likely special CM sweeper (Psychic/Ice Beam/Thunderbolt/Recover). Toxic applied turn 4—track poison damage (1/16 init, ticks up to 15/16). Expect CM attempts; if boosted, prioritize Recover over attacks to bait. Cradily can tank 1-2 boosted Ice Beams post-Recover. Shiftry sac with Explosion if Mewtwo low + last mon revealed. Opp remaining 2: Suspect Kyogre (Cradily walls Water/Thunder, Toxic it) or Groudon/Rayquaza (Shiftry CB Brick Break on Groudon, Shadow Ball on Ray if needed). No weather yet; Chlorophyll Shiftry useless without sun. Win con: Poison stall Mewtwo ~4-5 turns, then Shiftry sweeps/chips final threats.\n\nToxic applied to Mewtwo turn 4; poison damage starts at 1/16, ramps to 15/16. Expect Mewtwo to use Ice Beam (revealed) or Psychic (neutral, lower damage ~30-40%). Post-hit, Cradily likely at 40-60% HP; Recover next turn if survives. Track Mewtwo boosts or Recover usage. Remaining opp mon (1 unknown): Suspect Kyogre (wall with Toxic, Cradily resists Water) or Groudon/Rayquaza (switch to Shiftry CB Brick Break/Shadow Ball). Win con: Stall Mewtwo to ~50% via poison over 3-4 turns, Recover to full, then pivot to Shiftry vs final threats. Avoid switching now to not lose momentum."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Shiftry is my last Pokémon, facing Mewtwo at full HP, with opponent having one more unknown Pokémon. Mewtwo outspeeds and will likely use Ice Beam, which is resisted by Shiftry (Grass resists Ice), dealing minimal damage (~20-30%) from full HP. Shadow Ball is the optimal choice: super effective (Ghost vs Psychic), providing the best damage output among available moves without self-KOing via Explosion (which would end the battle immediately since I have no backups). Although special and not boosted by Choice Band, it should chunk Mewtwo for 40-50% based on stats. Locking into Shadow Ball is acceptable; it's neutral or useful against common Ubers like Kyogre (neutral), Groudon (neutral), or Rayquaza (neutral on Dragon/Flying). Brick Break is resisted (Fighting 0.5x on Psychic), Solar Beam requires a charge turn without sun, and Explosion sacrifices Shiftry prematurely. Post-hit, predict Mewtwo Recover or setup; aim to chip it down over turns while preserving HP for the final opponent.", "action": "shadowball", "scratchpad": "Correction: No Toxic on Mewtwo (log error in prior note).

Frail, easy OHKO target. Hitmontop revenge kills now, Intimidate crucial for survival. Preserve Jirachi for late-game setup vs special threats. Watch for opp switches to Ground-weak mons.\n\nDeoxys-A OHKO'd via HJK; expect opponent switch to something bulky like ground/steel type. Hitmontop post-KO can pivot or set up if safe. Preserve Jirachi/Cradily for walls. Watch for opponent's remaining threats: likely Wobbuffet, Kyogre, or Groudon based on Ubers meta.\n\nSwitched to Cradily to stall weakened Deoxys-A with Toxic/Recover. Monitor for opponent switch-ins; prepare Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Jirachi saved for special sweepers. Opponent likely has 3 mons left: suspect Kyogre/Groudon/Wobbuffet or similar Ubers meta threats.\n\nDeoxys-A targeted for OHKO with Rock Slide; if successful, expect switch-in from bulky Water/Ground/Steel like Kyogre/Groudon/Skarmory. Prioritize EQ for Groudon/Kyogre weaknesses, Toxic for walls. Jirachi remains preserved for special sweeping/setup against post-Deoxys threats. Opponent team likely: Deoxys-A, +3 Ubers (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Wobbuffet/Lugia). Monitor for priority or setup from switches.\n\nSwitched Jirachi into Metagross; expect ~5-10% from resisted Meteor Mash or ~70% from EQ—survives either. Next: Fire Punch for 2x chip (~25-35% est.) if no Agility, or Calm Mind if safe. Opp Metagross: standard physical set (Meteor Mash/EQ/Agility/Thunder Punch?), no Intimidate debuff. Preserve Cradily for Toxic/Recover stall vs Groudon/Kyogre. Opp team prediction: Deoxys-A, Metagross, +2 (likely Kyogre for special water threat to Jirachi, Groudon for sun/ground, or Wobbuffet trap—prioritize Jirachi vs special attackers). Watch for opp switches to exploit Jirachi's Steel/Psychic typing.\n\nHP Dark chips Metagross ~30-40%; expect Agility boost, EQ revenge, or switch to Ground-immune like Kyogre (threatens with Water Spout, but Jirachi tanks special neutrals post-setup). If Metagross stays, follow with CM or Psychic if boosted. Cradily switch if opp brings Groudon (EQ resists).

Staying in to attack with Hidden Power Dark would chip Metagross slightly (estimated ~15-20% based on previous ~17% at full HP, now lower), but Jirachi would faint regardless. Psychic is resisted by Metagross's Steel typing, Fire Punch is neutral but physical with lower Atk, and Calm Mind risks setup without survival. Switching to full-HP Cradily is optimal: Cradily takes neutral damage from Earthquake (Grass resists Ground 0.5x, Rock weak 2x = net 1x) and can tank it easily at 100% HP. Post-switch, Cradily can use Earthquake (super effective 2x on Metagross) to potentially KO or heavily damage, or Toxic/Recover to stall. This preserves Jirachi for late-game setup against special threats like potential Kyogre, while gaining momentum. Metagross is likely unboosted and slower than Jirachi, but switch handles the threat directly.

Metagross is faster and likely to repeat Earthquake from the previous turn, which Cradily resists (0.5x, ~35% damage based on prior hit, leaving ~35% HP before my move). This allows Cradily to survive and retaliate with Earthquake, which is 2x super effective (Ground vs Steel) and estimated to deal ~35-40% damage given Cradily's Rock Slide did 9% on resisted hit—scaling suggests solid chip to ~56-61% on Metagross. If Metagross uses Meteor Mash instead (2x SE on Cradily, ~89% damage, potential faint), we lose Cradily but confirm the move, allowing low-HP Jirachi to revenge next turn with Fire Punch (2x SE, Fire vs Steel) or Hidden Power (neutral chip). Switching Jirachi is suicidal into predicted EQ (2x SE, OHKO from low HP). Toxic or Recover carry faint risk from Mash without progressing damage; Earthquake balances aggression and safety against likely EQ, chipping the threat while preserving stall potential for next turn.

Frail, prioritize OHKO. Shiftry locked into Shadow Ball after switch. Watch for opp switches. Team plan: Use Shiftry as early wallbreaker vs Psychic threats; preserve Jirachi for setup/walling.\n\nDeoxys-A confirmed physical (Superpower user), -1 Atk/Def post-use; likely set: Superpower/Extreme Speed/Knock Off/Shadow Ball. Frail, easy OHKO target. Hitmontop revenge kills now, Intimidate crucial for survival. Preserve Jirachi for late-game setup vs special threats. Watch for opp switches to Ground-weak mons.\n\nDeoxys-A OHKO'd via HJK; expect opponent switch to something bulky like ground/steel type. Hitmontop post-KO can pivot or set up if safe. Preserve Jirachi/Cradily for walls. Watch for opponent's remaining threats: likely Wobbuffet, Kyogre, or Groudon based on Ubers meta.\n\nSwitched to Cradily to stall weakened Deoxys-A with Toxic/Recover. Monitor for opponent switch-ins; prepare Rock Slide/EQ for coverage. Jirachi saved for special sweepers. Opponent likely has 3 mons left: suspect Kyogre/Groudon/Wobbuffet or similar Ubers meta threats.\n\nDeoxys-A targeted for OHKO with Rock Slide; if successful, expect switch-in from bulky Water/Ground/Steel like Kyogre/Groudon/Skarmory. Prioritize EQ for Groudon/Kyogre weaknesses, Toxic for walls. Jirachi remains preserved for special sweeping/setup against post-Deoxys threats. Opponent team likely: Deoxys-A, +3 Ubers (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Wobbuffet/Lugia). Monitor for priority or setup from switches.\n\nSwitched Jirachi into Metagross; expect ~5-10% from resisted Meteor Mash or ~70% from EQ—survives either. Next: Fire Punch for 2x chip (~25-35% est.) if no Agility, or Calm Mind if safe. Opp Metagross: standard physical set (Meteor Mash/EQ/Agility/Thunder Punch?), no Intimidate debuff. Preserve Cradily for Toxic/Recover stall vs Groudon/Kyogre. Opp team prediction: Deoxys-A, Metagross, +2 (likely Kyogre for special water threat to Jirachi, Groudon for sun/ground, or Wobbuffet trap—prioritize Jirachi vs special attackers). Watch for opp switches to exploit Jirachi's Steel/Psychic typing.\n\nHP Dark chips Metagross ~30-40%; expect Agility boost, EQ revenge, or switch to Ground-immune like Kyogre (threatens with Water Spout, but Jirachi tanks special neutrals post-setup). If Metagross stays, follow with CM or Psychic if boosted. Cradily switch if opp brings Groudon (EQ resists). Opp team: Deoxys-A (fainted? weakened), Metagross, likely Kyogre/Groudon/Wobbuffet—prioritize CM vs special walls, Toxic via Cradily for stall.\n\nSwitched Cradily into Metagross to wall/take neutral EQ and prepare EQ retaliation (2x SE) or Toxic stall. Jirachi preserved at low HP for CM setup vs special attackers (e.g., Kyogre). Opp Metagross at 90%, physical set (Meteor Mash/EQ, possible Agility/TPunch); if switches, suspect to Kyogre (Cradily Toxic/Recover viable, weak to Water but stalls) or Groudon (EQ SE from Cradily). Remaining opp team: 2 mons, likely Kyogre/Groudon/Wobbuffet—position Cradily as stall core, sac if needed for Jirachi revenge.\n\nCradily EQ chips Metagross ~35-40% safely if EQ repeated; if Mash, sac and revenge with Jirachi Fire Punch (2x). Next: Toxic for stall if survives. Jirachi preserved for Kyogre special threat (CM + Psychic/HP). Opp remaining: Deoxys (-2 frail), +2 (Kyogre/Groudon probable)—EQ Kyogre/Groudon if switched in. Monitor for Agility boost on Metagross.\n\nLast mon: Jirachi at 17% vs Metagross 96% (physical set: Meteor Mash/EQ/Agility?). EQ will KO on switch-in; predict opp switch to non-Ground user (e.g., Kyogre for Water Spout threat—CM + Psychic to counter). If survives, CM immediately for late-game sweep potential vs remaining Ubers. Opp team est: Deoxys-A (alive? weakened from prior), Metagross, +2 (Kyogre/Groudon/Wobbuffet)—target special walls with setup, sac if needed but aim for hax wins."}], "response": {"reasoning": "This is the final turn with Jirachi as the last Pokémon at 23% HP against full-HP Metagross.

To maximize value, select the move that deals the most damage this turn. Hidden Power Dark is super effective against Metagross's Psychic typing (Dark SE on Psychic, neutral on Steel), and previously dealt ~17% from full HP. Psychic is resisted (0.5x due to Metagross's Psychic typing) despite STAB, making it weaker. Fire Punch is super effective against Steel but physical, hitting Metagross's higher Defense with Jirachi's lower Atk (212) compared to SpA (299), and no STAB, likely dealing less than HP Dark. Calm Mind would boost but Jirachi dies before benefiting. Opponent likely stays to KO, as switching risks unnecessary damage to other team members (e.g., frail Deoxys-A at -2 Atk/Def).

Any move I select will result in Tyranitar fainting before acting, as Mewtwo moves first. Therefore, switching is necessary to avoid losing Tyranitar without gaining value. Nidoking is the optimal switch-in: it is at full HP, takes neutral damage from Ice Beam (likely ~30-40% based on stats, survivable with Def 171 and HP 304), and is locked into Earthquake due to Choice Band from the first turn. EQ will deal significant neutral damage to Mewtwo's remaining 38% HP, with boosted Atk 283 likely KOing it or leaving it crippled. If Mewtwo Recovers or switches, Nidoking's speed (295) allows follow-up pressure, and EQ punishes common Ground-weak switches (e.g., potential Groudon). Preserving Kyogre for its rain sweep win condition is priority, as it risks heavy damage from super-effective Ice Beam. Hitmontop is less threatening offensively.

Since Slaking just switched in, it will act this turn and loaf the next, providing a safe setup opportunity if I switch to a tank. Staying in to use Surf or Thunder risks Kyogre fainting before acting, as Slaking likely outspeeds (base Speed 100 vs. Kyogre's 90). Calm Mind is risky at low HP, and Substitute is impossible (requires 25% HP). Switching to Tyranitar is poor due to its own low HP (18%) and weakness to potential Ground moves from Slaking. Instead, switch to Hitmontop: Its Intimidate ability activates on entry, lowering Slaking's Attack by one stage before it moves, allowing Hitmontop (full HP, solid Defense) to comfortably tank the hit.

Opponent remaining team likely includes weather setters (Groudon?) and sweepers (Salamence?); use Kyogre to counter fire/ground matchups.\n\nMewtwo at 38%, spamming Ice Beam so far—offensive set possible, but watch for Recover. If survives Surf, expect full HP next; follow with CM for sweep or Thunder/Surf to 2HKO. Rain ~4-5 turns left: maximize Surf/Thunder accuracy/power. Low-HP Tyranitar for late sand re-setup vs rain-weak foes. Hitmontop Intimidate reserved for physical threats like potential Rayquaza/Groudon.

Opponent may switch to resist Water (e.g., Grass/Electric like Venusaur or Zapdos) or Ground-immune; if Mewtwo stays, prioritize damaging it. Preserve low-HP Tyranitar for sand re-setup if rain ends.

Opponent remaining team likely includes weather setters (Groudon?) and sweepers (Salamence?); use Kyogre to counter fire/ground matchups.\n\nMewtwo at 38%, spamming Ice Beam so far—offensive set possible, but watch for Recover. If survives Surf, expect full HP next; follow with CM for sweep or Thunder/Surf to 2HKO. Rain ~4-5 turns left: maximize Surf/Thunder accuracy/power. Low-HP Tyranitar for late sand re-setup vs rain-weak foes. Hitmontop Intimidate reserved for physical threats like potential Rayquaza/Groudon. Opponent remaining: likely Groudon (counter rain), Salamence (sand/dragon), or stall like Blissey—use Kyogre to pressure weather-dependent mons.\n\nSlaking revealed: Physical attacker with Truant, likely set with Return/EQ/Shadow Claw/Facade; full HP, unknown item but assume no Choice. Switches in after Mewtwo sac—opponent sacrificing to bring in powerhouse. Hitmontop Intimidate + Bulk Up plan vs Slaking; HJK for STAB damage post-setup. Remaining opponent mon: Likely weather counter (Groudon?) or dragon (Salamence/Rayquaza) for sand/dragon synergy.

Watch for switches to Groudon or other Ubers. Nidoking locked into EQ after this; plan switches if needed. Team win con: Kyogre rain sweep or Tyranitar sand setup.\n\nMewtwo revealed: likely special attacker with Psychic/Recover/Thunderbolt/Ice Beam. Switch to Tyranitar to wall it and set sand. Opponent may sac or switch to Ground-immune like Rayquaza. Preserve Nidoking for breaking walls like Blissey/Shedinja if present. Kyogre for rain control vs fire/ground threats.\n\nMewtwo potential moves: Psychic (neutral on Ttar), Recover, Thunderbolt (resisted), Ice Beam (resisted). If Rock Slide doesn't KO, expect switch to Ground/Steel resist like Metagross or Aggron; preserve Kyogre for rain vs potential Groudon/Salamence. Nidoking for post-setup cleanup. Monitor sand turns (1 left after this).\n\nSandstorm: ~2 turns left after this (set on turn 2). Opponent Mewtwo set: Special attacker, Ice Beam confirmed, possible Recover/Psychic/Thunderbolt. If Mewtwo survives Nidoking EQ, sac Nidoking next turn for Kyogre setup or Hitmontop Intimidate on physical threats. Watch for opponent Ground immunes (e.g., Rayquaza, Metagross) on switch prediction—EQ still pressures many Ubers. Opponent team likely includes Groudon/Salamence for sand synergy; position Kyogre rain to counter. Tyranitar preserved at low HP for late-game cleanup if possible.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre vs low-HP Mewtwo; expect Ice Beam or Psychic, tankable. Rain sets up Kyogre sweep with CM + Surf/Thunder. Opponent may switch to resist Water (e.g., Grass/Electric like Venusaur or Zapdos) or Ground-immune; if Mewtwo stays, prioritize damaging it. Preserve low-HP Tyranitar for sand re-setup if rain ends. Hitmontop for Intimidate on physical Ubers like Rayquaza. Opponent remaining team likely includes weather setters (Groudon?) and sweepers (Salamence?); use Kyogre to counter fire/ground matchups.\n\nMewtwo at 38%, spamming Ice Beam so far—offensive set possible, but watch for Recover. If survives Surf, expect full HP next; follow with CM for sweep or Thunder/Surf to 2HKO. Rain ~4-5 turns left: maximize Surf/Thunder accuracy/power. Low-HP Tyranitar for late sand re-setup vs rain-weak foes. Hitmontop Intimidate reserved for physical threats like potential Rayquaza/Groudon. Opponent remaining: likely Groudon (counter rain), Salamence (sand/dragon), or stall like Blissey—use Kyogre to pressure weather-dependent mons.\n\nSlaking revealed: Physical attacker with Truant, likely set with Return/EQ/Shadow Claw/Facade; full HP, unknown item but assume no Choice. Switches in after Mewtwo sac—opponent sacrificing to bring in powerhouse. Hitmontop Intimidate + Bulk Up plan vs Slaking; HJK for STAB damage post-setup. Remaining opponent mon: Likely weather counter (Groudon?) or dragon (Salamence/Rayquaza) for sand/dragon synergy. Preserve low-HP Kyogre for rain vs fire/ground threats after Hitmontop handles Slaking. Low-HP Tyranitar for potential sand re-setup if rain fades. Rain ~4 turns left: Position Kyogre post-Slaking.\n\nHitmontop sacrificed to Intimidate Slaking (Atk -1 confirmed). Slaking Truant cycle: Attacked turn 6, likely loafs turn 8. Focus Punch incoming this turn—prioritize tanking with Tyranitar. If survives, Rock Slide/EQ for damage (neutral). Opponent last mon: Suspect Groudon (sand/ground vs rain counter) or Rayquaza (dragon immunity). Use Kyogre post-Slaking to pressure with Surf/Thunder under rain. Lum Berry on Tyranitar may activate if status, but not here. Overall: KO Slaking, then Kyogre sweeps last mon.\n\nSlaking confirmed physical attacker with Focus Punch (high power, but Truant limits). Likely set: Return/EQ/Shadow Claw/Focus Punch; no item revealed, but full HP on switch suggests no prior damage. Truant cycle: Loafs turn 7, attacks turn 8 (if alive). Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and threatens KO with Rock Slide (+1 Atk ~550 effective power). If Slaking survives, EQ as backup. Opponent last mon: High chance Groudon (counters rain with sun/ground) or Rayquaza (dragon immunity to EQ, sand boost). If Groudon, switch to Kyogre for Surf/Thunder under re-rain; if Rayquaza, Tyranitar Rock Slide resists Extreme Speed. Preserve Kyogre low-HP for final sweep vs fire/ground-weak foes. Sand ~5 turns left post-this.\n\nRock Slide to KO Slaking this turn; confirm if OHKO (expected with +1 Atk). Opponent last mon: Prioritize Groudon counter with Kyogre Surf/Thunder under Drizzle; if Rayquaza, Tyranitar Rock Slide pressures Dragon. Sand ~4 turns left post-this; re-setup if rain countered. Kyogre at 11% for final sweep—protect with Sub if possible, but low HP risks sac. Win con: Tyranitar cleanup vs non-ground last mon."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Slaking is loafing this turn due to Truant, so I can act unopposed without risk. At 32% HP, Rock Slide from +1 Atk Tyranitar should easily OHKO it, as the previous base Rock Slide dealt around 50% damage. Securing the KO now eliminates a major physical threat and forces out the opponent's last Pokemon, allowing me to position accordingly next turn. DD would overcommit boosts on low-HP Tyranitar, and EQ/Hidden Power are unnecessary when Rock Slide guarantees the KO neutrally. Post-KO, if opponent sends Groudon, switch to Kyogre for rain Surf/Thunder pressure; if Rayquaza, stay in for Rock Slide resisted by Dragon but pressured by STAB. Preserve Kyogre's low HP for the final matchup.", "action": "rockslide", "scratchpad": "Rock Slide OHKOs loafing Slaking at 32%.

Watch for switches to Groudon or other Ubers. Nidoking locked into EQ after this; plan switches if needed. Team win con: Kyogre rain sweep or Tyranitar sand setup.\n\nMewtwo revealed: likely special attacker with Psychic/Recover/Thunderbolt/Ice Beam. Switch to Tyranitar to wall it and set sand. Opponent may sac or switch to Ground-immune like Rayquaza. Preserve Nidoking for breaking walls like Blissey/Shedinja if present. Kyogre for rain control vs fire/ground threats.\n\nMewtwo potential moves: Psychic (neutral on Ttar), Recover, Thunderbolt (resisted), Ice Beam (resisted). If Rock Slide doesn't KO, expect switch to Ground/Steel resist like Metagross or Aggron; preserve Kyogre for rain vs potential Groudon/Salamence. Nidoking for post-setup cleanup. Monitor sand turns (1 left after this).\n\nSandstorm: ~2 turns left after this (set on turn 2). Opponent Mewtwo set: Special attacker, Ice Beam confirmed, possible Recover/Psychic/Thunderbolt. If Mewtwo survives Nidoking EQ, sac Nidoking next turn for Kyogre setup or Hitmontop Intimidate on physical threats. Watch for opponent Ground immunes (e.g., Rayquaza, Metagross) on switch prediction—EQ still pressures many Ubers. Opponent team likely includes Groudon/Salamence for sand synergy; position Kyogre rain to counter. Tyranitar preserved at low HP for late-game cleanup if possible.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre vs low-HP Mewtwo; expect Ice Beam or Psychic, tankable. Rain sets up Kyogre sweep with CM + Surf/Thunder. Opponent may switch to resist Water (e.g., Grass/Electric like Venusaur or Zapdos) or Ground-immune; if Mewtwo stays, prioritize damaging it. Preserve low-HP Tyranitar for sand re-setup if rain ends. Hitmontop for Intimidate on physical Ubers like Rayquaza. Opponent remaining team likely includes weather setters (Groudon?) and sweepers (Salamence?); use Kyogre to counter fire/ground matchups.\n\nMewtwo at 38%, spamming Ice Beam so far—offensive set possible, but watch for Recover. If survives Surf, expect full HP next; follow with CM for sweep or Thunder/Surf to 2HKO. Rain ~4-5 turns left: maximize Surf/Thunder accuracy/power. Low-HP Tyranitar for late sand re-setup vs rain-weak foes. Hitmontop Intimidate reserved for physical threats like potential Rayquaza/Groudon. Opponent remaining: likely Groudon (counter rain), Salamence (sand/dragon), or stall like Blissey—use Kyogre to pressure weather-dependent mons.\n\nSlaking revealed: Physical attacker with Truant, likely set with Return/EQ/Shadow Claw/Facade; full HP, unknown item but assume no Choice. Switches in after Mewtwo sac—opponent sacrificing to bring in powerhouse. Hitmontop Intimidate + Bulk Up plan vs Slaking; HJK for STAB damage post-setup. Remaining opponent mon: Likely weather counter (Groudon?) or dragon (Salamence/Rayquaza) for sand/dragon synergy. Preserve low-HP Kyogre for rain vs fire/ground threats after Hitmontop handles Slaking. Low-HP Tyranitar for potential sand re-setup if rain fades. Rain ~4 turns left: Position Kyogre post-Slaking.\n\nHitmontop sacrificed to Intimidate Slaking (Atk -1 confirmed). Slaking Truant cycle: Attacked turn 6, likely loafs turn 8. Focus Punch incoming this turn—prioritize tanking with Tyranitar. If survives, Rock Slide/EQ for damage (neutral). Opponent last mon: Suspect Groudon (sand/ground vs rain counter) or Rayquaza (dragon immunity). Use Kyogre post-Slaking to pressure with Surf/Thunder under rain. Lum Berry on Tyranitar may activate if status, but not here. Overall: KO Slaking, then Kyogre sweeps last mon.\n\nSlaking confirmed physical attacker with Focus Punch (high power, but Truant limits). Likely set: Return/EQ/Shadow Claw/Focus Punch; no item revealed, but full HP on switch suggests no prior damage. Truant cycle: Loafs turn 7, attacks turn 8 (if alive). Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and threatens KO with Rock Slide (+1 Atk ~550 effective power). If Slaking survives, EQ as backup. Opponent last mon: High chance Groudon (counters rain with sun/ground) or Rayquaza (dragon immunity to EQ, sand boost). If Groudon, switch to Kyogre for Surf/Thunder under re-rain; if Rayquaza, Tyranitar Rock Slide resists Extreme Speed. Preserve Kyogre low-HP for final sweep vs fire/ground-weak foes. Sand ~5 turns left post-this.\n\nRock Slide to KO Slaking this turn; confirm if OHKO (expected with +1 Atk). Opponent last mon: Prioritize Groudon counter with Kyogre Surf/Thunder under Drizzle; if Rayquaza, Tyranitar Rock Slide pressures Dragon. Sand ~4 turns left post-this; re-setup if rain countered. Kyogre at 11% for final sweep—protect with Sub if possible, but low HP risks sac. Win con: Tyranitar cleanup vs non-ground last mon.\n\nRock Slide OHKOs loafing Slaking at 32%. Opponent last mon likely Groudon (switch to Kyogre rain for Surf/Thunder 2HKO under Drizzle) or Rayquaza (stay Tyranitar for Rock Slide/EQ pressure, resists potential Draco/Outrage). Sand ~3 turns left post-this; re-setup if needed vs non-ground foe. Win con: Kyogre sweeps last mon or Tyranitar cleans up if favorable."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Tyranitar outspeeds Swampert significantly (+1 Spe, 243 base vs 60). Staying in and using Hidden Power Dark maximizes chip damage (neutral STAB vs Rock Slide's 0.5x resist), estimated ~30-40% to Swampert. Swampert likely uses Earthquake to OHKO low-HP Tyranitar (super effective). Then switch to Kyogre safely, setting Drizzle (rain). Upkeep sets rain. Next turn (11), Kyogre outspeeds and uses Surf (rain-boosted, neutral 1x on Swampert, high SpA should OHKO after chip). Thunder ineffective (Ground immune). Substitute impossible at 11% HP. Switching now risks EQ hitting Kyogre (super effective, likely OHKO at 11%). Opponent expects stay-in attack, so EQ targets Tyranitar.

Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Preserve Nidoking for future wallbreaking. Watch for Mewtwo coverage like Shadow Ball (super effective on Ttar). Sandstorm active post-switch for chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nTyranitar DD plan initiated; after +1, outspeeds Mewtwo. Monitor for Mewtwo's coverage (likely Psychic/Aura Sphere/Recover/CM/Shadow Ball). If Mewtwo CMs, pivot to physical pressure advantage. Opponent's remaining 3: watch for Lugia/Ho-Oh walls, Groudon, or other Ubers. Kyogre rain switch after Ttar weakens special threats.\n\nMewtwo confirmed no Levitate (EQ would hit); likely special attacker with coverage like Psychic/Recover/Shadow Ball. Rock Slide on Ttar: expect heavy chip, possible flinch survival. If Ttar faints, switch to Kyogre next for Drizzle rain to boost Surf/Thunder and pressure damaged Mewtwo (likely OHKO). Preserve Nidoking's Choice Band for wallbreaking other threats. Opponent may switch to anti-physical like Lugia if predicting attack; watch for that. Remaining opponent team: potential Groudon (resists Rock/EQ), Ho-Oh, or Rayquaza.\n\nTyranitar fainted to Mewtwo Ice Beam (confirmed special attacker, Ice Beam coverage; likely Recover/Psychic/Shadow Ball/Aura Sphere set). Kyogre switch to rain-sweep low-HP Mewtwo (Surf OHKO post-Recover). Opponent Mewtwo ~22% now, sand chip pending but rain overrides. If Mewtwo attacks on switch (Ice Beam 2x but survivable), still KO next; watch for Shadow Ball (neutral on Kyogre).

On turn 8, Slaking will attack and likely KO Nidoking (high chance of CB Focus Punch or similar physical move). After Nidoking faints, switch to Kyogre (still at 21% HP, no bench recovery). End of turn 8: Kyogre recovers to ~27% via Leftovers under rain. Turn 9: Slaking loafs again, allowing Kyogre to OHKO Slaking with boosted Surf (rain Water STAB, neutral on Normal, Slaking's low SpD). Opponent then sends last Pokémon. Rain lasts until end of turn 8, so turn 9 has no boost but Thunder remains accurate. Switching Kyogre now would be risky: safe on loaf, but turn 8 Slaking likely KOs low-HP Kyogre, leaving Nidoking to face full-HP Slaking later without progress. Staying in maximizes damage output.

likely special attacker/spinner. Watch for switches to Ground-immune threats like Levitate users or Waters. My team plan: Use Nidoking as early wallbreaker, pivot to Tyranitar for sand if needed, save Kyogre for rain sweep, Hitmontop for physical checks. Track damage outputs and opponent reveals.\n\nMewtwo (Psychic, Pressure, item unknown) - likely Calm Mind/Psychic/Aura Sphere/Recover set; immune to Psychic with Ttar switch successful. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Preserve Nidoking for future wallbreaking. Watch for Mewtwo coverage like Shadow Ball (super effective on Ttar). Sandstorm active post-switch for chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nTyranitar DD plan initiated; after +1, outspeeds Mewtwo. Monitor for Mewtwo's coverage (likely Psychic/Aura Sphere/Recover/CM/Shadow Ball). If Mewtwo CMs, pivot to physical pressure advantage. Opponent's remaining 3: watch for Lugia/Ho-Oh walls, Groudon, or other Ubers. Kyogre rain switch after Ttar weakens special threats.\n\nMewtwo confirmed no Levitate (EQ would hit); likely special attacker with coverage like Psychic/Recover/Shadow Ball. Rock Slide on Ttar: expect heavy chip, possible flinch survival. If Ttar faints, switch to Kyogre next for Drizzle rain to boost Surf/Thunder and pressure damaged Mewtwo (likely OHKO). Preserve Nidoking's Choice Band for wallbreaking other threats. Opponent may switch to anti-physical like Lugia if predicting attack; watch for that. Remaining opponent team: potential Groudon (resists Rock/EQ), Ho-Oh, or Rayquaza.\n\nTyranitar fainted to Mewtwo Ice Beam (confirmed special attacker, Ice Beam coverage; likely Recover/Psychic/Shadow Ball/Aura Sphere set). Kyogre switch to rain-sweep low-HP Mewtwo (Surf OHKO post-Recover). Opponent Mewtwo ~22% now, sand chip pending but rain overrides. If Mewtwo attacks on switch (Ice Beam 2x but survivable), still KO next; watch for Shadow Ball (neutral on Kyogre). Remaining opponent 3: anticipate Groudon (EQ threat to Kyogre), Lugia/Ho-Oh (stall vs rain), Rayquaza (setup sweeper). Preserve CB Nidoking for breaking walls post-Mewtwo; Hitmontop for Intimidate physical pivots. Long-term: rain advantage vs non-Water Absorb threats.\n\nMewtwo low HP; likely Recover but OHKO'd by rain Surf regardless. Post-KO, expect switch to Groudon (Water resist, Thunder SE) or Lugia (stall, Surf chips). Preserve Nidoking CB for breaking walls like Skarmory if present; Hitmontop for Intimidate vs physical threats. Rain enables 100% Thunder accuracy for coverage. Track if Mewtwo has Aura Sphere (super effective on Kyogre but low damage vs bulk). Opponent remaining: likely Groudon/Kyogre mirror/Ho-Oh/Lugia/Rayquaza/Deoxys.\n\nSlaking revealed: Normal, Truant, item unknown; physical threat with Return/EQ likely, low SpD. Hitmontop Intimidate pivot to KO on loaf turn. Kyogre 21% HP, recover with Leftovers under rain. Nidoking CB-locked to Earthquake, save for Ground-weak foes. Opponent remaining 2: expect Groudon (Water/Thunder resist, EQ threat), Lugia/Ho-Oh (stall), or Rayquaza. Post-Slaking, rain Surf/Thunder for coverage; watch switches to resists.\n\nSlaking: Truant confirmed, Atk -1 from prior Intimidate (persists), Focus Punch incoming (strong physical, likely CB possible since OHKO'd Hitmontop at -1). If Nidoking survives, CB EQ ~70% damage turn 8 (loaf), then Slaking attacks turn 9 (may KO Nidoking), switch Kyogre turn 10 (loaf, free Surf/Thunder ~75-90% from full even chipped). Opponent last mon: likely Groudon (resists Water, weak Thunder) or Lugia (stall, chips in rain); position Kyogre Calm Mind if safe. Rain 5 turns left, prioritize special pressure.\n\nNidoking EQ turn 7: Slaking to ~30%. Sac to turn 8 KO, switch Kyogre (21% -> ~27% LO). Turn 9 loaf: Kyogre Surf OHKO Slaking. Last opp mon switches turn 9 post-KO, no rain turn 10+. Prep Kyogre CM/Sub if bulky foe (e.g., Groudon Thunder SE, Lugia Surf chips). Opp last: likely Groudon (resists Water, Thunder 2x), Lugia/Ho-Oh stall, Rayquaza setup; EQ lock irrelevant post-faint."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Turn 8: Slaking is loafing due to Truant, providing a free hit. Nidoking is Choice Band locked to Earthquake from the previous turn. EQ is neutral on Slaking but Nidoking's boosted Attack with CB should deal around 46% damage again, dropping Slaking from 54% to near 0%, likely KOing it. This removes Slaking without risk. After KO, opponent will switch in their last remaining Pokémon (team of 4, with Omastar, Mewtwo, and now Slaking fainted). Rain is active and will have one final upkeep after this turn before ending. Post-KO, I'll need to decide on turn 9 whether to stay with Nidoking (still EQ locked, risky depending on switch-in) or switch to Kyogre (21% HP, but can use Thunder/Surf under final rain turn for potential coverage; Leftovers will heal it slightly during upkeep).

Else, switch Kyogre for final rain-boosted Surf/Thunder (e.g., OHKO Groudon with Thunder, chip Lugia). Kyogre at ~27% post-LO upkeep.

Sandstorm active post-switch for chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nTyranitar DD plan initiated; after +1, outspeeds Mewtwo. Monitor for Mewtwo's coverage (likely Psychic/Aura Sphere/Recover/CM/Shadow Ball). If Mewtwo CMs, pivot to physical pressure advantage. Opponent's remaining 3: watch for Lugia/Ho-Oh walls, Groudon, or other Ubers. Kyogre rain switch after Ttar weakens special threats.\n\nMewtwo confirmed no Levitate (EQ would hit); likely special attacker with coverage like Psychic/Recover/Shadow Ball. Rock Slide on Ttar: expect heavy chip, possible flinch survival. If Ttar faints, switch to Kyogre next for Drizzle rain to boost Surf/Thunder and pressure damaged Mewtwo (likely OHKO). Preserve Nidoking's Choice Band for wallbreaking other threats. Opponent may switch to anti-physical like Lugia if predicting attack; watch for that. Remaining opponent team: potential Groudon (resists Rock/EQ), Ho-Oh, or Rayquaza.\n\nTyranitar fainted to Mewtwo Ice Beam (confirmed special attacker, Ice Beam coverage; likely Recover/Psychic/Shadow Ball/Aura Sphere set). Kyogre switch to rain-sweep low-HP Mewtwo (Surf OHKO post-Recover). Opponent Mewtwo ~22% now, sand chip pending but rain overrides. If Mewtwo attacks on switch (Ice Beam 2x but survivable), still KO next; watch for Shadow Ball (neutral on Kyogre). Remaining opponent 3: anticipate Groudon (EQ threat to Kyogre), Lugia/Ho-Oh (stall vs rain), Rayquaza (setup sweeper). Preserve CB Nidoking for breaking walls post-Mewtwo; Hitmontop for Intimidate physical pivots. Long-term: rain advantage vs non-Water Absorb threats.\n\nMewtwo low HP; likely Recover but OHKO'd by rain Surf regardless. Post-KO, expect switch to Groudon (Water resist, Thunder SE) or Lugia (stall, Surf chips). Preserve Nidoking CB for breaking walls like Skarmory if present; Hitmontop for Intimidate vs physical threats. Rain enables 100% Thunder accuracy for coverage. Track if Mewtwo has Aura Sphere (super effective on Kyogre but low damage vs bulk). Opponent remaining: likely Groudon/Kyogre mirror/Ho-Oh/Lugia/Rayquaza/Deoxys.\n\nSlaking revealed: Normal, Truant, item unknown; physical threat with Return/EQ likely, low SpD. Hitmontop Intimidate pivot to KO on loaf turn. Kyogre 21% HP, recover with Leftovers under rain. Nidoking CB-locked to Earthquake, save for Ground-weak foes. Opponent remaining 2: expect Groudon (Water/Thunder resist, EQ threat), Lugia/Ho-Oh (stall), or Rayquaza. Post-Slaking, rain Surf/Thunder for coverage; watch switches to resists.\n\nSlaking: Truant confirmed, Atk -1 from prior Intimidate (persists), Focus Punch incoming (strong physical, likely CB possible since OHKO'd Hitmontop at -1). If Nidoking survives, CB EQ ~70% damage turn 8 (loaf), then Slaking attacks turn 9 (may KO Nidoking), switch Kyogre turn 10 (loaf, free Surf/Thunder ~75-90% from full even chipped). Opponent last mon: likely Groudon (resists Water, weak Thunder) or Lugia (stall, chips in rain); position Kyogre Calm Mind if safe. Rain 5 turns left, prioritize special pressure.\n\nNidoking EQ turn 7: Slaking to ~30%. Sac to turn 8 KO, switch Kyogre (21% -> ~27% LO). Turn 9 loaf: Kyogre Surf OHKO Slaking. Last opp mon switches turn 9 post-KO, no rain turn 10+. Prep Kyogre CM/Sub if bulky foe (e.g., Groudon Thunder SE, Lugia Surf chips). Opp last: likely Groudon (resists Water, Thunder 2x), Lugia/Ho-Oh stall, Rayquaza setup; EQ lock irrelevant post-faint.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 8 via free EQ. Opponent switches last mon turn 8 end. Rain ends after turn 8 upkeep (5 turns total). Turn 9: Nidoking EQ locked; if switch-in weak to Ground (e.g., not Groudon/Lugia), stay for potential chip/KO. Else, switch Kyogre for final rain-boosted Surf/Thunder (e.g., OHKO Groudon with Thunder, chip Lugia). Kyogre at ~27% post-LO upkeep.

At 9% HP, Slaking will be OHKOed by Choice Band Earthquake (STAB Ground vs Normal, 2x effective, Nidoking's high Atk 283). Since Nidoking moves first, it KOs Slaking before Focus Punch can be executed, avoiding any damage. This sacs nothing and reveals the opponent's last Pokemon. After KO, rain has ended (5 turns expired after turn 8 upkeep), so no boost for Kyogre's Water/Electric moves, but Kyogre at 21% can still pressure with Surf/Thunder or set up Calm Mind/Sub against the final threat (likely Groudon, which is immune to Thunder but weak to nothing on Kyogre; use CM/Sub to stall or chip). Switching now would expose Kyogre to Focus Punch (neutral, but Slaking's power even at -1 Atk and 9% HP likely KOs Kyogre's low physical bulk from 21%, losing the mon for no gain as Slaking survives).

Staying in would result in Nidoking taking a likely super-effective Earthquake from Swampert, probably resulting in a KO given Nidoking's defenses and the STAB super-effective hit. Switching to Kyogre is necessary to avoid this while positioning our special attacker. Kyogre's low HP (21%) is risky, but Swampert's likely attacking move is a Water-type attack (e.g., Waterfall or Hydro Pump) expecting Nidoking to stay, which would be neutral on Kyogre and potentially survivable due to its high special bulk (though physical hit, still bulky). If Swampert predicts the switch and uses Earthquake, Kyogre may faint, but that's a 50/50 prediction game we must take to have any chance. Post-switch, if Kyogre survives, we can use Substitute or Calm Mind to stall and chip with resisted boosted Surf (rain still active this turn), recovering with Leftovers.

likely special attacker/spinner. Watch for switches to Ground-immune threats like Levitate users or Waters. My team plan: Use Nidoking as early wallbreaker, pivot to Tyranitar for sand if needed, save Kyogre for rain sweep, Hitmontop for physical checks. Track damage outputs and opponent reveals.\n\nMewtwo (Psychic, Pressure, item unknown) - likely Calm Mind/Psychic/Aura Sphere/Recover set; immune to Psychic with Ttar switch successful. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Preserve Nidoking for future wallbreaking. Watch for Mewtwo coverage like Shadow Ball (super effective on Ttar). Sandstorm active post-switch for chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nTyranitar DD plan initiated; after +1, outspeeds Mewtwo. Monitor for Mewtwo's coverage (likely Psychic/Aura Sphere/Recover/CM/Shadow Ball). If Mewtwo CMs, pivot to physical pressure advantage. Opponent's remaining 3: watch for Lugia/Ho-Oh walls, Groudon, or other Ubers. Kyogre rain switch after Ttar weakens special threats.\n\nMewtwo confirmed no Levitate (EQ would hit); likely special attacker with coverage like Psychic/Recover/Shadow Ball. Rock Slide on Ttar: expect heavy chip, possible flinch survival. If Ttar faints, switch to Kyogre next for Drizzle rain to boost Surf/Thunder and pressure damaged Mewtwo (likely OHKO). Preserve Nidoking's Choice Band for wallbreaking other threats. Opponent may switch to anti-physical like Lugia if predicting attack; watch for that. Remaining opponent team: potential Groudon (resists Rock/EQ), Ho-Oh, or Rayquaza.\n\nTyranitar fainted to Mewtwo Ice Beam (confirmed special attacker, Ice Beam coverage; likely Recover/Psychic/Shadow Ball/Aura Sphere set). Kyogre switch to rain-sweep low-HP Mewtwo (Surf OHKO post-Recover). Opponent Mewtwo ~22% now, sand chip pending but rain overrides. If Mewtwo attacks on switch (Ice Beam 2x but survivable), still KO next; watch for Shadow Ball (neutral on Kyogre). Remaining opponent 3: anticipate Groudon (EQ threat to Kyogre), Lugia/Ho-Oh (stall vs rain), Rayquaza (setup sweeper). Preserve CB Nidoking for breaking walls post-Mewtwo; Hitmontop for Intimidate physical pivots. Long-term: rain advantage vs non-Water Absorb threats.\n\nMewtwo low HP; likely Recover but OHKO'd by rain Surf regardless. Post-KO, expect switch to Groudon (Water resist, Thunder SE) or Lugia (stall, Surf chips). Preserve Nidoking CB for breaking walls like Skarmory if present; Hitmontop for Intimidate vs physical threats. Rain enables 100% Thunder accuracy for coverage. Track if Mewtwo has Aura Sphere (super effective on Kyogre but low damage vs bulk). Opponent remaining: likely Groudon/Kyogre mirror/Ho-Oh/Lugia/Rayquaza/Deoxys.\n\nSlaking revealed: Normal, Truant, item unknown; physical threat with Return/EQ likely, low SpD. Hitmontop Intimidate pivot to KO on loaf turn. Kyogre 21% HP, recover with Leftovers under rain. Nidoking CB-locked to Earthquake, save for Ground-weak foes. Opponent remaining 2: expect Groudon (Water/Thunder resist, EQ threat), Lugia/Ho-Oh (stall), or Rayquaza. Post-Slaking, rain Surf/Thunder for coverage; watch switches to resists.\n\nSlaking: Truant confirmed, Atk -1 from prior Intimidate (persists), Focus Punch incoming (strong physical, likely CB possible since OHKO'd Hitmontop at -1). If Nidoking survives, CB EQ ~70% damage turn 8 (loaf), then Slaking attacks turn 9 (may KO Nidoking), switch Kyogre turn 10 (loaf, free Surf/Thunder ~75-90% from full even chipped). Opponent last mon: likely Groudon (resists Water, weak Thunder) or Lugia (stall, chips in rain); position Kyogre Calm Mind if safe. Rain 5 turns left, prioritize special pressure.\n\nNidoking EQ turn 7: Slaking to ~30%. Sac to turn 8 KO, switch Kyogre (21% -> ~27% LO). Turn 9 loaf: Kyogre Surf OHKO Slaking. Last opp mon switches turn 9 post-KO, no rain turn 10+. Prep Kyogre CM/Sub if bulky foe (e.g., Groudon Thunder SE, Lugia Surf chips). Opp last: likely Groudon (resists Water, Thunder 2x), Lugia/Ho-Oh stall, Rayquaza setup; EQ lock irrelevant post-faint.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 8 via free EQ. Opponent switches last mon turn 8 end. Rain ends after turn 8 upkeep (5 turns total). Turn 9: Nidoking EQ locked; if switch-in weak to Ground (e.g., not Groudon/Lugia), stay for potential chip/KO. Else, switch Kyogre for final rain-boosted Surf/Thunder (e.g., OHKO Groudon with Thunder, chip Lugia). Kyogre at ~27% post-LO upkeep. Long-term win: Pressure last mon with rain coverage if possible; Nidoking backup if physical wall. Watch for Deoxys/Rayquaza speed/setup threats.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 9 via priority speed EQ. Opponent reveals final mon (predict Groudon: resists Surf, immune Thunder; use Kyogre CM/Sub to stall/chip, or Nidoking switch-in for EQ if Ground-weak alternative). No rain: Kyogre 21% LO recovery ongoing, prioritize setup vs stall (Lugia/Ho-Oh) or direct pressure vs setup (Rayquaza/Deoxys). Nidoking remains for post-Kyogre cleanup if survives. Win con: Outlast final threat with special pressure or physical backup.\n\nSwampert final mon: Water/Ground, Torrent, unknown item/moves (likely physical: EQ/Waterfall/Ice Beam). Immune to Thunder/EQ, resists Surf; Kyogre plan: switch in, sub/CM to stall/chip with resisted Surf (LO recovery), avoid predicted EQ. If Kyogre faints, Nidoking cleans up weakened Swampert with Megahorn (neutral) or other moves post-lock. Win con: Kyogre bulk outlasts Swampert's damage output, no rain post-turn 10.\n\nSwampert final mon: Water/Ground, Torrent, full HP, knows EQ (physical threat). Nidoking CB: switch in, then Ice Beam (neutral, best vs immunity to EQ; locks CB). Outs peeds; double Ice Beam may significantly chip or KO bulky set. Watch for Swampert coverage (Ice Beam/Aqua Jet possible). If Nidoking faints quickly, battle over; aim to outdamage."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Nidoking has switched back in after being out, breaking the Choice Band lock, allowing selection of any move.

Megahorn is the strongest option: physical Bug move with neutral effectiveness, boosted by Choice Band (effective Atk ~425) and base power 120, expected to deal 50-70% damage to full-HP Swampert based on bulk. Sludge Bomb is STAB but resisted (0.5x) and special with low SpA (206). Ice Beam is neutral but special and lower power (90 BP) without boosts. Earthquake does 0 damage.

Track if Omastar survives for damage calc. Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible. Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and can KO or heavily damage Mewtwo. Monitor Mewtwo HP after sand chip (now 94%, -6% this turn). Opponent has 3 unknown Pokemon; prepare Kyogre switch if Mewtwo goes for Thunder or switches to Electric threat. Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1). CB EQ likely OHKOs Slaking; if not, follow-up next turn. Opponent has 2 unknown Pokemon left—EQ hits most neutrally, immune to Electric/Flying if they switch those. Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later.

From previous damage, EQ dealt 45% to Slaking, so at 55% HP, it should KO Slaking outright as a neutral hit with STAB and Choice Band boost. This removes Slaking without Nidoking taking damage from Focus Punch, as Nidoking moves first. Post-KO, Nidoking remains locked into EQ, which could be predicted against switches (e.g., ineffective vs Flying or Levitate types like potential Rayquaza or Zapdos). However, securing the KO now is optimal to reduce opponent's team to 2 unknowns, likely Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre.

Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible.

Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1).

Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later. Hitmontop full as defensive option against special attackers.\n\nSlaking KO'd by Nidoking EQ. Opponent down to 2 Pokémon: likely Electric/Grass types to counter Kyogre. Nidoking ~23% and locked into EQ—switch out next turn based on opponent's reveal (e.g., Tyranitar vs physical threats, Hitmontop to Intimidate special attackers, Kyogre only if safe).

Track if Omastar survives for damage calc. Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible. Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and can KO or heavily damage Mewtwo. Monitor Mewtwo HP after sand chip (now 94%, -6% this turn). Opponent has 3 unknown Pokemon; prepare Kyogre switch if Mewtwo goes for Thunder or switches to Electric threat. Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1). CB EQ likely OHKOs Slaking; if not, follow-up next turn. Opponent has 2 unknown Pokemon left—EQ hits most neutrally, immune to Electric/Flying if they switch those. Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later. Hitmontop full as defensive option against special attackers.\n\nSlaking KO'd by Nidoking EQ. Opponent down to 2 Pokémon: likely Electric/Grass types to counter Kyogre. Nidoking ~23% and locked into EQ—switch out next turn based on opponent's reveal (e.g., Tyranitar vs physical threats, Hitmontop to Intimidate special attackers, Kyogre only if safe). Rain expires post-turn; prioritize Tyranitar entry for sand chip damage and DD setup if matchup favors. Preserve Hitmontop as late-game pivot; Kyogre can CM under new sand if needed, but low HP risks revenge.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 9 via safe EQ. Opponent's final Pokémon switches in; likely a strong Ubers threat (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon, Lugia). Next turn: switch Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate and preserve locked low-HP Nidoking. Evaluate last mon's type/ role upon reveal: HJK if weak to Fighting, Rock Slide for Flying, HP (likely Flying/Grass) for coverage, Bulk Up if setup safe. If last mon special attacker, Hitmontop SpD tanky; pivot back to Tyranitar if physical. Kyogre/Tyranitar low but Lum/LO for stall or sac if needed. Win con: Hitmontop revenge or setup vs last mon.\n\nSwampert revealed: Water/Ground, Torrent, likely physical with EQ/Water STAB/Ice coverage; immune to EQ, threatens Water-weak foes in rain. Switched Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate (lowers ATK) and safe scouting—HJK neutral but Bulk Up possible post-Intimidate. Opponent's final unknown mon: prepare for Ubers threat (e.g., Electric/Grass for Kyogre, physical wall). Post-rain end, pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream chip and DD if matchup good; Kyogre low but can CM under sand if protected. Win con: Hitmontop stalls/sets vs Swampert, then sweep with boosted team vs last mon; preserve low-HP mons for sacs if needed."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Hitmontop is at critically low HP (10.83%) and cannot survive another hit from Swampert, especially a predicted Earthquake. However, Hitmontop outspeeds Swampert (Spe 204 vs. estimated <204), allowing it to use High Jump Kick first. HJK is Hitmontop's strongest neutral move against Swampert (Water/Ground), dealing significant damage (estimated 40-50% based on stats: Atk 317, 130 BP, 1.5x STAB vs. Swampert's Def ~250-300). This chips Swampert substantially before it KOs Hitmontop, preserving higher-value teammates. Switching risks immediate KOs: Nidoking (23% HP, locked into ineffective EQ vs. Swampert's immunity) likely dies to Waterfall; Tyranitar (17% HP, 2x weak to Water moves) and Kyogre (13% HP, neutral to EQ but frail physically) are also too low to reliably tank. Post-sac, switch Nidoking in next turn for CB-boosted EQ (0.5x on Swampert but high power from Atk ~425 effective, estimated 30-40% more damage), setting up a potential KO. Rain persists, boosting Swampert's Water moves, but Intimidate (-1 Atk) mitigates physical threat. Long-term: Break Swampert, then pivot to Tyranitar for sand/Dragon Dance or Kyogre for Calm Mind against final unknown mon.", "action": "highjumpkick", "scratchpad": "Hitmontop sac with HJK: est. 40-50% to Swampert. Next turn: Switch Nidoking vs. damaged Swampert for CB EQ (~30-40% more, total possible KO). If Swampert survives, expect Torrent Waterfall; Nidoking vulnerable but Ground STAB helps vs. last mon if switches. Final mon unknown—anticipate Electric/Grass (Kyogre counters) or physical wall; use Tyranitar sand chip/DD setup post-rain end (upkeep continues 8 turns). Kyogre CM opportunity once safe. Preserve Lum on Tyranitar for status. Win con: Nidoking + team sweeps final two."}, "outcome": "loss", "is_valid_response": true}

Track if Omastar survives for damage calc. Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible. Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and can KO or heavily damage Mewtwo. Monitor Mewtwo HP after sand chip (now 94%, -6% this turn). Opponent has 3 unknown Pokemon; prepare Kyogre switch if Mewtwo goes for Thunder or switches to Electric threat. Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1). CB EQ likely OHKOs Slaking; if not, follow-up next turn. Opponent has 2 unknown Pokemon left—EQ hits most neutrally, immune to Electric/Flying if they switch those. Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later. Hitmontop full as defensive option against special attackers.\n\nSlaking KO'd by Nidoking EQ. Opponent down to 2 Pokémon: likely Electric/Grass types to counter Kyogre. Nidoking ~23% and locked into EQ—switch out next turn based on opponent's reveal (e.g., Tyranitar vs physical threats, Hitmontop to Intimidate special attackers, Kyogre only if safe). Rain expires post-turn; prioritize Tyranitar entry for sand chip damage and DD setup if matchup favors. Preserve Hitmontop as late-game pivot; Kyogre can CM under new sand if needed, but low HP risks revenge.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 9 via safe EQ. Opponent's final Pokémon switches in; likely a strong Ubers threat (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon, Lugia). Next turn: switch Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate and preserve locked low-HP Nidoking. Evaluate last mon's type/ role upon reveal: HJK if weak to Fighting, Rock Slide for Flying, HP (likely Flying/Grass) for coverage, Bulk Up if setup safe. If last mon special attacker, Hitmontop SpD tanky; pivot back to Tyranitar if physical. Kyogre/Tyranitar low but Lum/LO for stall or sac if needed. Win con: Hitmontop revenge or setup vs last mon.\n\nSwampert revealed: Water/Ground, Torrent, likely physical with EQ/Water STAB/Ice coverage; immune to EQ, threatens Water-weak foes in rain. Switched Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate (lowers ATK) and safe scouting—HJK neutral but Bulk Up possible post-Intimidate. Opponent's final unknown mon: prepare for Ubers threat (e.g., Electric/Grass for Kyogre, physical wall). Post-rain end, pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream chip and DD if matchup good; Kyogre low but can CM under sand if protected. Win con: Hitmontop stalls/sets vs Swampert, then sweep with boosted team vs last mon; preserve low-HP mons for sacs if needed.\n\nHitmontop sac with HJK: est. 40-50% to Swampert. Next turn: Switch Nidoking vs. damaged Swampert for CB EQ (~30-40% more, total possible KO). If Swampert survives, expect Torrent Waterfall; Nidoking vulnerable but Ground STAB helps vs. last mon if switches. Final mon unknown—anticipate Electric/Grass (Kyogre counters) or physical wall; use Tyranitar sand chip/DD setup post-rain end (upkeep continues 8 turns). Kyogre CM opportunity once safe. Preserve Lum on Tyranitar for status. Win con: Nidoking + team sweeps final two."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Hitmontop has fainted, requiring a switch. Kyogre and Tyranitar are both at critically low HP (13% and 17%) and would be KO'd by Swampert's Earthquake (neutral damage estimated at ~40-50% based on prior damage to Hitmontop, exceeding their remaining HP). Nidoking, being Ground-type, is immune to Earthquake, allowing a safe switch-in this turn despite being locked into Earthquake (which will also whiff against Swampert's Ground typing). This forfeits our move this turn but preserves Kyogre and Tyranitar as win conditions for late-game sweeping (Kyogre CM under rain/sand, Tyranitar DD in sand). Next turn, Nidoking will likely be KO'd by Hydro Pump (neutral, rain-boosted, ~100% at 23% HP), allowing a pivot to Kyogre (resists Water STAB) to absorb and set up against Swampert.", "action": "nidoking", "scratchpad": "Sac Nidoking to whiff EQ this turn; expect Hydro Pump KO next.

Evaluate last mon's type/ role upon reveal: HJK if weak to Fighting, Rock Slide for Flying, HP (likely Flying/Grass) for coverage, Bulk Up if setup safe. If last mon special attacker, Hitmontop SpD tanky; pivot back to Tyranitar if physical. Kyogre/Tyranitar low but Lum/LO for stall or sac if needed.

Track if Omastar survives for damage calc. Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible. Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and can KO or heavily damage Mewtwo. Monitor Mewtwo HP after sand chip (now 94%, -6% this turn). Opponent has 3 unknown Pokemon; prepare Kyogre switch if Mewtwo goes for Thunder or switches to Electric threat. Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1). CB EQ likely OHKOs Slaking; if not, follow-up next turn. Opponent has 2 unknown Pokemon left—EQ hits most neutrally, immune to Electric/Flying if they switch those. Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later. Hitmontop full as defensive option against special attackers.\n\nSlaking KO'd by Nidoking EQ. Opponent down to 2 Pokémon: likely Electric/Grass types to counter Kyogre. Nidoking ~23% and locked into EQ—switch out next turn based on opponent's reveal (e.g., Tyranitar vs physical threats, Hitmontop to Intimidate special attackers, Kyogre only if safe). Rain expires post-turn; prioritize Tyranitar entry for sand chip damage and DD setup if matchup favors. Preserve Hitmontop as late-game pivot; Kyogre can CM under new sand if needed, but low HP risks revenge.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 9 via safe EQ. Opponent's final Pokémon switches in; likely a strong Ubers threat (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon, Lugia). Next turn: switch Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate and preserve locked low-HP Nidoking. Evaluate last mon's type/ role upon reveal: HJK if weak to Fighting, Rock Slide for Flying, HP (likely Flying/Grass) for coverage, Bulk Up if setup safe. If last mon special attacker, Hitmontop SpD tanky; pivot back to Tyranitar if physical. Kyogre/Tyranitar low but Lum/LO for stall or sac if needed. Win con: Hitmontop revenge or setup vs last mon.\n\nSwampert revealed: Water/Ground, Torrent, likely physical with EQ/Water STAB/Ice coverage; immune to EQ, threatens Water-weak foes in rain. Switched Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate (lowers ATK) and safe scouting—HJK neutral but Bulk Up possible post-Intimidate. Opponent's final unknown mon: prepare for Ubers threat (e.g., Electric/Grass for Kyogre, physical wall). Post-rain end, pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream chip and DD if matchup good; Kyogre low but can CM under sand if protected. Win con: Hitmontop stalls/sets vs Swampert, then sweep with boosted team vs last mon; preserve low-HP mons for sacs if needed.\n\nHitmontop sac with HJK: est. 40-50% to Swampert. Next turn: Switch Nidoking vs. damaged Swampert for CB EQ (~30-40% more, total possible KO). If Swampert survives, expect Torrent Waterfall; Nidoking vulnerable but Ground STAB helps vs. last mon if switches. Final mon unknown—anticipate Electric/Grass (Kyogre counters) or physical wall; use Tyranitar sand chip/DD setup post-rain end (upkeep continues 8 turns). Kyogre CM opportunity once safe. Preserve Lum on Tyranitar for status. Win con: Nidoking + team sweeps final two.\n\nSac Nidoking to whiff EQ this turn; expect Hydro Pump KO next. Pivot to Kyogre post-sac (resists Hydro Pump, can CM vs Swampert's low SpA). Tyranitar preserved for sand reset/DD vs final mon (likely Electric/Grass threat). Swampert 74%, -1 Atk; Hydro Pump locked if Choice, else EQ. Final opponent mon unknown—heavy Ubers threat; use sand chip/Intimidate if possible, but team low HP requires careful sacs/positioning for CM/DD sweeps.\n\nSwitched Kyogre in vs Swampert (80%, -1 Atk); plan CM setup next turn if Swampert stays (tanks Water/EQ neutrally, Ice Beam resisted if coverage). Nidoking preserved at 23% for EQ revenge vs last mon (e.g., Flying/Electric threats). Tyranitar at 17% for potential sand reset/DD vs final Ubers (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon). Opponent's last mon unknown—heavy threat likely; Kyogre LO recovery + rain boosts Surf/Thunder for sweep. Win con: CM Kyogre KOs Swampert then last mon; sac low-HP mons if needed for momentum.\n\nSac'd Nidoking vs Swampert; next send Kyogre for safe entry. Post-rain end, Kyogre CM/Surf plan: est.

Staying in allows us to deal chip damage before fainting. Among physical moves, Rock Slide provides the best damage output: STAB-boosted (effective power ~56 after resistance) with Tyranitar's high Attack (367), potentially 20-30% to Swampert, plus 30% flinch chance. Since Tyranitar is faster, it strikes first. Earthquake does slightly less (no STAB), and Hidden Power Dark is special (low SpA 203), so minimal damage. Switching Nidoking risks an immediate super-effective Hydro Pump KO (2x, Nidoking at 23% SpD), leaving Swampert undamaged. Better to sac Tyranitar productively, then bring in Nidoking vs chipped Swampert. Nidoking can then use Ice Beam (super effective 2x on Swampert, SpA 206), likely finishing it off or pressuring heavily. Nidoking wasn't locked last time (switched without moving), so free choice. If flinch procs (30%), Tyranitar survives to face opponent's last Pokémon, enabling Dragon Dance setup or attack.

Track if Omastar survives for damage calc. Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible. Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and can KO or heavily damage Mewtwo. Monitor Mewtwo HP after sand chip (now 94%, -6% this turn). Opponent has 3 unknown Pokemon; prepare Kyogre switch if Mewtwo goes for Thunder or switches to Electric threat. Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1). CB EQ likely OHKOs Slaking; if not, follow-up next turn. Opponent has 2 unknown Pokemon left—EQ hits most neutrally, immune to Electric/Flying if they switch those. Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later. Hitmontop full as defensive option against special attackers.\n\nSlaking KO'd by Nidoking EQ. Opponent down to 2 Pokémon: likely Electric/Grass types to counter Kyogre. Nidoking ~23% and locked into EQ—switch out next turn based on opponent's reveal (e.g., Tyranitar vs physical threats, Hitmontop to Intimidate special attackers, Kyogre only if safe). Rain expires post-turn; prioritize Tyranitar entry for sand chip damage and DD setup if matchup favors. Preserve Hitmontop as late-game pivot; Kyogre can CM under new sand if needed, but low HP risks revenge.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 9 via safe EQ. Opponent's final Pokémon switches in; likely a strong Ubers threat (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon, Lugia). Next turn: switch Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate and preserve locked low-HP Nidoking. Evaluate last mon's type/ role upon reveal: HJK if weak to Fighting, Rock Slide for Flying, HP (likely Flying/Grass) for coverage, Bulk Up if setup safe. If last mon special attacker, Hitmontop SpD tanky; pivot back to Tyranitar if physical. Kyogre/Tyranitar low but Lum/LO for stall or sac if needed. Win con: Hitmontop revenge or setup vs last mon.\n\nSwampert revealed: Water/Ground, Torrent, likely physical with EQ/Water STAB/Ice coverage; immune to EQ, threatens Water-weak foes in rain. Switched Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate (lowers ATK) and safe scouting—HJK neutral but Bulk Up possible post-Intimidate. Opponent's final unknown mon: prepare for Ubers threat (e.g., Electric/Grass for Kyogre, physical wall). Post-rain end, pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream chip and DD if matchup good; Kyogre low but can CM under sand if protected. Win con: Hitmontop stalls/sets vs Swampert, then sweep with boosted team vs last mon; preserve low-HP mons for sacs if needed.\n\nHitmontop sac with HJK: est. 40-50% to Swampert. Next turn: Switch Nidoking vs. damaged Swampert for CB EQ (~30-40% more, total possible KO). If Swampert survives, expect Torrent Waterfall; Nidoking vulnerable but Ground STAB helps vs. last mon if switches. Final mon unknown—anticipate Electric/Grass (Kyogre counters) or physical wall; use Tyranitar sand chip/DD setup post-rain end (upkeep continues 8 turns). Kyogre CM opportunity once safe. Preserve Lum on Tyranitar for status. Win con: Nidoking + team sweeps final two.\n\nSac Nidoking to whiff EQ this turn; expect Hydro Pump KO next. Pivot to Kyogre post-sac (resists Hydro Pump, can CM vs Swampert's low SpA). Tyranitar preserved for sand reset/DD vs final mon (likely Electric/Grass threat). Swampert 74%, -1 Atk; Hydro Pump locked if Choice, else EQ. Final opponent mon unknown—heavy Ubers threat; use sand chip/Intimidate if possible, but team low HP requires careful sacs/positioning for CM/DD sweeps.\n\nSwitched Kyogre in vs Swampert (80%, -1 Atk); plan CM setup next turn if Swampert stays (tanks Water/EQ neutrally, Ice Beam resisted if coverage). Nidoking preserved at 23% for EQ revenge vs last mon (e.g., Flying/Electric threats). Tyranitar at 17% for potential sand reset/DD vs final Ubers (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon). Opponent's last mon unknown—heavy threat likely; Kyogre LO recovery + rain boosts Surf/Thunder for sweep. Win con: CM Kyogre KOs Swampert then last mon; sac low-HP mons if needed for momentum.\n\nSac'd Nidoking vs Swampert; next send Kyogre for safe entry. Post-rain end, Kyogre CM/Surf plan: est. Surf ~40-60% to Swampert (resisted, rain), then Thunder/Surf vs final mon if Electric/Grass. Tyranitar last: DD under sand reset for sweep if matchup allows (Rock Slide vs Grass/Flying, EQ vs Electric/Poison). Swampert mixed set confirmed (EQ physical, Hydro Pump special); Torrent activates below 33%. Opponent final mon: anticipate Ubers counter like Venusaur/Torterra (Grass), Zapdos (Electric/Flying), or wall like Blissey—use sand chip + Intimidate gone, but Tyranitar walls special neutrals.\n\nSwampert confirmed mixed attacker (EQ physical, Hydro Pump special), Leftovers, -1 Atk persists this turn but resets next. Likely switches out after Tyranitar faint to preserve vs Nidoking Ice Beam threat. Final opponent mon: anticipate Electric/Flying (e.g., Zapdos) or Grass (e.g., Venusaur) to counter prior Water/Ground synergy; Nidoking Ice Beam super vs both, but watch for Ground immunity or Ice resist. If last mon revealed as physical wall, Nidoking Megahorn/Sludge Bomb alt but locked post-Ice. Tyranitar Lum unused—potential status sac if needed, but fainted likely. Post-Swampert KO, Nidoking at 23% must revenge final mon; no backups left."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Tyranitar has fainted upon switching in or due to prior damage not reflected in the log, but current state shows it as FNT and active, with only Nidoking remaining viable. Must switch Nidoking in as the last Pokémon to face Swampert at 73% HP with -1 Attack under sandstorm. Nidoking is faster and at 23% HP; upon entry, it can select a move next turn. Plan to use Ice Beam for neutral damage against Swampert, as Earthquake is immune, Megahorn and Sludge Bomb are resisted. This chips Swampert, and being Choice Band, locks Nidoking into Ice Beam, which provides good coverage against potential final threats like Grass, Ground, Flying, or Dragon types.", "action": "nidoking", "scratchpad": "Last mon: Nidoking 23% vs Swampert 73% -1 Atk, sandstorm (Nidoking chips 1/16 ~4-5% per turn). Faster; Ice Beam neutral special hit to chip ~30-50% est. (spa 206 vs SpD ~250+, 90 BP no STAB). Swampert likely Hydro Pump (1x to Nidoking, low HP risks KO) or EQ (neutral 2x but -1 Atk, CB Nidoking def 171 low). Opponent has 2 unknown mons left (full team 6: Omastar/Mewtwo/Slaking/Swampert +2). Ice Beam lock covers supers on Grass/Ground/Flying/Dragon (common Ubers like Rayquaza, Garchomp, Zapdos, Venusaur); neutral on Electric/Water/Fire.

Track if Omastar survives for damage calc. Overall strategy: Use Nidoking to break early walls, pivot to Kyogre for rain control if needed, Tyranitar for sand offense, Hitmontop as defensive pivot.\n\nOpponent's Mewtwo likely special attacker with Psychic STAB; Tyranitar walls it perfectly due to immunity. Opponent has 3 Pokemon left unknown. Prioritize sand setup for Tyranitar offense; preserve Nidoking if possible by switching out now. Watch for Mewtwo's coverage moves like Ice Beam or Thunderbolt that could threaten Tyranitar.\n\nMewtwo confirmed Ice Beam coverage; likely special attacker with Recover possible. Post-DD Tyranitar outspeeds and can KO or heavily damage Mewtwo. Monitor Mewtwo HP after sand chip (now 94%, -6% this turn). Opponent has 3 unknown Pokemon; prepare Kyogre switch if Mewtwo goes for Thunder or switches to Electric threat. Nidoking preserved for wallbreaking.\n\nSwitched to Kyogre to safely absorb Mewtwo's attacks. Kyogre can set up Calm Mind next turn if Mewtwo stays in. Tyranitar at low HP; consider sacking if needed later, but Lum Berry unused. Opponent's remaining 3 Pokemon unknown; watch for threats to Kyogre like Electric or Grass types. Maintain sand chip damage on non-Rock/Ground/Steel foes.\n\nMewtwo at 88% pre-turn; Thunder likely KOs. Common Mewtwo sets include Recover, so if it survives, expect healing next. Opponent's unknowns may include Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre—preserve Nidoking/Tyranitar for those. Post-KO, pivot back to Tyranitar for sand setup or use Kyogre to sweep with boosted Surf/Thunder. Hitmontop as last resort pivot.\n\nNidoking locked into Earthquake (used turn 1). CB EQ likely OHKOs Slaking; if not, follow-up next turn. Opponent has 2 unknown Pokemon left—EQ hits most neutrally, immune to Electric/Flying if they switch those. Post-Slaking KO, evaluate switch-ins: Tyranitar for sand if rain ends or to DD further; Kyogre can recover with LO and set CM later under rain. Hitmontop as pivot if needed against special threats. Track opponent's last two: possible Electric/Grass counters to Kyogre, physical walls for Nidoking.\n\nSlaking FNT after EQ KO. Opponent down to 2 unknown Pokemon—likely includes counters to Kyogre (Electric/Grass) or walls. Nidoking post-KO at ~23% HP, locked into EQ; switch out carefully next turn to avoid revenge kills. Rain ends after this turn's upkeep; pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream reset and potential DD setup. Kyogre low but can recover with LO under short rain or CM later. Hitmontop full as defensive option against special attackers.\n\nSlaking KO'd by Nidoking EQ. Opponent down to 2 Pokémon: likely Electric/Grass types to counter Kyogre. Nidoking ~23% and locked into EQ—switch out next turn based on opponent's reveal (e.g., Tyranitar vs physical threats, Hitmontop to Intimidate special attackers, Kyogre only if safe). Rain expires post-turn; prioritize Tyranitar entry for sand chip damage and DD setup if matchup favors. Preserve Hitmontop as late-game pivot; Kyogre can CM under new sand if needed, but low HP risks revenge.\n\nSlaking KO'd turn 9 via safe EQ. Opponent's final Pokémon switches in; likely a strong Ubers threat (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon, Lugia). Next turn: switch Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate and preserve locked low-HP Nidoking. Evaluate last mon's type/ role upon reveal: HJK if weak to Fighting, Rock Slide for Flying, HP (likely Flying/Grass) for coverage, Bulk Up if setup safe. If last mon special attacker, Hitmontop SpD tanky; pivot back to Tyranitar if physical. Kyogre/Tyranitar low but Lum/LO for stall or sac if needed. Win con: Hitmontop revenge or setup vs last mon.\n\nSwampert revealed: Water/Ground, Torrent, likely physical with EQ/Water STAB/Ice coverage; immune to EQ, threatens Water-weak foes in rain. Switched Nidoking to Hitmontop for Intimidate (lowers ATK) and safe scouting—HJK neutral but Bulk Up possible post-Intimidate. Opponent's final unknown mon: prepare for Ubers threat (e.g., Electric/Grass for Kyogre, physical wall). Post-rain end, pivot to Tyranitar for Sand Stream chip and DD if matchup good; Kyogre low but can CM under sand if protected. Win con: Hitmontop stalls/sets vs Swampert, then sweep with boosted team vs last mon; preserve low-HP mons for sacs if needed.\n\nHitmontop sac with HJK: est. 40-50% to Swampert. Next turn: Switch Nidoking vs. damaged Swampert for CB EQ (~30-40% more, total possible KO). If Swampert survives, expect Torrent Waterfall; Nidoking vulnerable but Ground STAB helps vs. last mon if switches. Final mon unknown—anticipate Electric/Grass (Kyogre counters) or physical wall; use Tyranitar sand chip/DD setup post-rain end (upkeep continues 8 turns). Kyogre CM opportunity once safe. Preserve Lum on Tyranitar for status. Win con: Nidoking + team sweeps final two.\n\nSac Nidoking to whiff EQ this turn; expect Hydro Pump KO next. Pivot to Kyogre post-sac (resists Hydro Pump, can CM vs Swampert's low SpA). Tyranitar preserved for sand reset/DD vs final mon (likely Electric/Grass threat). Swampert 74%, -1 Atk; Hydro Pump locked if Choice, else EQ. Final opponent mon unknown—heavy Ubers threat; use sand chip/Intimidate if possible, but team low HP requires careful sacs/positioning for CM/DD sweeps.\n\nSwitched Kyogre in vs Swampert (80%, -1 Atk); plan CM setup next turn if Swampert stays (tanks Water/EQ neutrally, Ice Beam resisted if coverage). Nidoking preserved at 23% for EQ revenge vs last mon (e.g., Flying/Electric threats). Tyranitar at 17% for potential sand reset/DD vs final Ubers (e.g., Rayquaza, Groudon). Opponent's last mon unknown—heavy threat likely; Kyogre LO recovery + rain boosts Surf/Thunder for sweep. Win con: CM Kyogre KOs Swampert then last mon; sac low-HP mons if needed for momentum.\n\nSac'd Nidoking vs Swampert; next send Kyogre for safe entry. Post-rain end, Kyogre CM/Surf plan: est. Surf ~40-60% to Swampert (resisted, rain), then Thunder/Surf vs final mon if Electric/Grass. Tyranitar last: DD under sand reset for sweep if matchup allows (Rock Slide vs Grass/Flying, EQ vs Electric/Poison). Swampert mixed set confirmed (EQ physical, Hydro Pump special); Torrent activates below 33%. Opponent final mon: anticipate Ubers counter like Venusaur/Torterra (Grass), Zapdos (Electric/Flying), or wall like Blissey—use sand chip + Intimidate gone, but Tyranitar walls special neutrals.\n\nSwampert confirmed mixed attacker (EQ physical, Hydro Pump special), Leftovers, -1 Atk persists this turn but resets next. Likely switches out after Tyranitar faint to preserve vs Nidoking Ice Beam threat. Final opponent mon: anticipate Electric/Flying (e.g., Zapdos) or Grass (e.g., Venusaur) to counter prior Water/Ground synergy; Nidoking Ice Beam super vs both, but watch for Ground immunity or Ice resist. If last mon revealed as physical wall, Nidoking Megahorn/Sludge Bomb alt but locked post-Ice. Tyranitar Lum unused—potential status sac if needed, but fainted likely. Post-Swampert KO, Nidoking at 23% must revenge final mon; no backups left.\n\nLast mon: Nidoking 23% vs Swampert 73% -1 Atk, sandstorm (Nidoking chips 1/16 ~4-5% per turn). Faster; Ice Beam neutral special hit to chip ~30-50% est. (spa 206 vs SpD ~250+, 90 BP no STAB). Swampert likely Hydro Pump (1x to Nidoking, low HP risks KO) or EQ (neutral 2x but -1 Atk, CB Nidoking def 171 low). Opponent has 2 unknown mons left (full team 6: Omastar/Mewtwo/Slaking/Swampert +2). Ice Beam lock covers supers on Grass/Ground/Flying/Dragon (common Ubers like Rayquaza, Garchomp, Zapdos, Venusaur); neutral on Electric/Water/Fire. If Swampert KOs, lost; else, revenge final two with sand chip + Ice Beam. No pivots left—aggressive chip and pray."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Nidoking is the last Pokémon and faster than Swampert (295 Spe vs. estimated 180-200). Since switching in newly without prior move selection this stint, Choice Band allows any move choice. Earthquake is useless (immunity). Megahorn offers strong neutral physical damage (~20-30% est. based on prior calcs) but poor coverage on predicted switches (Electric/Flying like Zapdos or Grass like Venusaur). Sludge Bomb is resisted. Ice Beam provides solid neutral special damage to Swampert (~30-50%) and super effective coverage on common remaining threats (Grass, Flying, Dragon, Ground), potentially KOing switches or forcing bad plays. Opponent likely KOs Nidoking with Hydro Pump (super effective Water, 2x on Ground) afterward, but this maximizes chip and threat.

Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage).

Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened.

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar outspeeds Groudon and is immune to its Earthquake due to Levitate. Groudon is already burned, so Will-O-Wisp is redundant. Taunt could prevent a potential Swords Dance, but with only 38% HP remaining, Ice Punch should KO it outright based on previous damage output (~40-45% per hit, super effective physical Ice). If the opponent switches out, Ice Punch could still pressure common switch-ins like Rayquaza (4x weak to Ice) or other Grounds/Dragons. Thunderbolt is neutral on Groudon and saved for potential Kyogre later. Switching risks losing momentum, as Misdreavus is low HP and Granbull could be hit hard by whatever comes in.

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed.\n\nGroudon at 38% brn, physical set (EQ/SD likely); Ice Punch expected to KO, gaining free faint. Sun est. 2 turns left post-this. Post-KO, anticipate Kyogre switch (T-Bolt revenge, as sun weakens Water but Gengar resists/neutral); Rayquaza/Mewtwo possible (Ice Punch/Taunt). Preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened rematch; Misdreavus sac trap if setup threat emerges. Momentum with Gengar: Taunt setups, status physicals, coverage kills.\n\nSkarmory (F, full HP) switched in post-Groudon KO; likely defensive pivot w/ Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind, Sturdy possible. Thunderbolt SE chunk expected (high SpA vs mid SpD). Sun ~1-2 turns left (weakens potential Kyogre Water). Opp rem: likely Kyogre (Tbolt revenge), Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Pressure Skarmory, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs endgame; Misdreavus sac trap if setup emerges.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via T-Bolt; hazards (1 Spikes) active—minimize switches (Misdreavus sac only if trap needed, Granbull switch incurs 1/8 ~45 HP loss). Sun ending, favors vs potential Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, Water weakened). Opp final two: Prioritize T-Bolt (Kyogre/Water/Flying), Ice Punch (Rayquaza/Ground/Dragon), Taunt (Mewtwo/setup), Will-O-Wisp (physical threats). Gengar at ~91% post-turn, strong position; pivot to full HP Granbull for Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs endgame weakened team. Win con: Coverage kill threats, then Granbull cleans."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar outspeeds Celebi and is in a strong position at high HP. Celebi is a bulky support Pokemon likely carrying Recover, Leech Seed, or Baton Pass for healing/setup. Taunt prevents these non-attacking moves, forcing Celebi to attack or switch, allowing Gengar to retaliate effectively next turn. Gengar's Ghost typing resists potential Giga Drain, though weak to Psychic; however, Taunt disrupts Celebi's strategy and maintains momentum. Switching incurs Spikes damage, unnecessary here as Gengar pressures well. Ice Punch would chip but not KO Celebi's bulk, and Thunderbolt is neutral—Taunt sets up a free hit. Sun ending soon, but irrelevant for this matchup. Post-Taunt, prepare coverage for likely remaining threats like Kyogre (Thunderbolt) or Rayquaza (Ice Punch). Pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep afterward.", "action": "taunt", "scratchpad": "Celebi switched in full HP, Natural Cure (cures status on switch, but irrelevant now); assume special/support set (Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Baton Pass/Lum Berry?).

Gengar near full, pressure with coverage post-Taunt. Granbull full HP for endgame Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs weakened foes; avoid switch (Spikes ~12% loss). Misdreavus low HP sac trap if setup emerges later. Win con: Disrupt Celebi, KO with follow-up, clean with Granbull."}, "outcome": "loss", "is_valid_response": true}

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed.\n\nGroudon at 38% brn, physical set (EQ/SD likely); Ice Punch expected to KO, gaining free faint. Sun est. 2 turns left post-this. Post-KO, anticipate Kyogre switch (T-Bolt revenge, as sun weakens Water but Gengar resists/neutral); Rayquaza/Mewtwo possible (Ice Punch/Taunt). Preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened rematch; Misdreavus sac trap if setup threat emerges. Momentum with Gengar: Taunt setups, status physicals, coverage kills.\n\nSkarmory (F, full HP) switched in post-Groudon KO; likely defensive pivot w/ Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind, Sturdy possible. Thunderbolt SE chunk expected (high SpA vs mid SpD). Sun ~1-2 turns left (weakens potential Kyogre Water). Opp rem: likely Kyogre (Tbolt revenge), Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Pressure Skarmory, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs endgame; Misdreavus sac trap if setup emerges.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via T-Bolt; hazards (1 Spikes) active—minimize switches (Misdreavus sac only if trap needed, Granbull switch incurs 1/8 ~45 HP loss). Sun ending, favors vs potential Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, Water weakened). Opp final two: Prioritize T-Bolt (Kyogre/Water/Flying), Ice Punch (Rayquaza/Ground/Dragon), Taunt (Mewtwo/setup), Will-O-Wisp (physical threats). Gengar at ~91% post-turn, strong position; pivot to full HP Granbull for Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs endgame weakened team. Win con: Coverage kill threats, then Granbull cleans.\n\nCelebi switched in full HP, Natural Cure (cures status on switch, but irrelevant now); assume special/support set (Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Baton Pass/Lum Berry?). Taunt to deny healing/setup, force suboptimal play. Opponent's last two likely Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water) or Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Gengar near full, pressure with coverage post-Taunt. Granbull full HP for endgame Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs weakened foes; avoid switch (Spikes ~12% loss). Misdreavus low HP sac trap if setup emerges later. Win con: Disrupt Celebi, KO with follow-up, clean with Granbull."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar is faster than Celebi and low on HP (21%). Celebi is Taunted, so it will likely use Psychic again, which is super effective and would KO Gengar (previous hit did ~75% from higher HP). Thunderbolt would chunk Celebi neutrally but not KO, leading to Gengar's sacrifice. Will-O-Wisp or another Taunt is suboptimal (burn ineffective on special attacker, Taunt already active for 2 more turns). Ice Punch resisted by Celebi. Switching Misdreavus (low HP) risks KO on switch-in + hit. Switching to full-HP Granbull is best: takes neutral Psychic (survivable given bulk/SpD), Intimidate (minor, but active ability), then threaten with Return/EQ/Bulk Up. Preserves Gengar for revenge kill on last mon (likely Kyogre/Rayquaza via Tbolt/Ice Punch). Spikes damage ~12%, negligible for Granbull. Momentum shift to physical pressure post-Taunt wears off.", "action": "granbull", "scratchpad": "Celebi: special attacker (Psychic confirmed), Taunted (2 turns left); likely support set w/ Recover/Giga Drain but denied.

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed.\n\nGroudon at 38% brn, physical set (EQ/SD likely); Ice Punch expected to KO, gaining free faint. Sun est. 2 turns left post-this. Post-KO, anticipate Kyogre switch (T-Bolt revenge, as sun weakens Water but Gengar resists/neutral); Rayquaza/Mewtwo possible (Ice Punch/Taunt). Preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened rematch; Misdreavus sac trap if setup threat emerges. Momentum with Gengar: Taunt setups, status physicals, coverage kills.\n\nSkarmory (F, full HP) switched in post-Groudon KO; likely defensive pivot w/ Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind, Sturdy possible. Thunderbolt SE chunk expected (high SpA vs mid SpD). Sun ~1-2 turns left (weakens potential Kyogre Water). Opp rem: likely Kyogre (Tbolt revenge), Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Pressure Skarmory, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs endgame; Misdreavus sac trap if setup emerges.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via T-Bolt; hazards (1 Spikes) active—minimize switches (Misdreavus sac only if trap needed, Granbull switch incurs 1/8 ~45 HP loss). Sun ending, favors vs potential Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, Water weakened). Opp final two: Prioritize T-Bolt (Kyogre/Water/Flying), Ice Punch (Rayquaza/Ground/Dragon), Taunt (Mewtwo/setup), Will-O-Wisp (physical threats). Gengar at ~91% post-turn, strong position; pivot to full HP Granbull for Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs endgame weakened team. Win con: Coverage kill threats, then Granbull cleans.\n\nCelebi switched in full HP, Natural Cure (cures status on switch, but irrelevant now); assume special/support set (Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Baton Pass/Lum Berry?). Taunt to deny healing/setup, force suboptimal play. Opponent's last two likely Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water) or Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Gengar near full, pressure with coverage post-Taunt. Granbull full HP for endgame Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs weakened foes; avoid switch (Spikes ~12% loss). Misdreavus low HP sac trap if setup emerges later. Win con: Disrupt Celebi, KO with follow-up, clean with Granbull.\n\nCelebi: special attacker (Psychic confirmed), Taunted (2 turns left); likely support set w/ Recover/Giga Drain but denied. Switched to Granbull to tank hit, preserve Gengar for coverage vs final mon. Opp last mon: high priority Tbolt/Ice Punch targets (Kyogre water weaken sun, Rayquaza dragon). Granbull plan: Bulk Up x1-2 + Return/EQ sweep endgame; Rest if needed. Spikes 1 layer—minimize further switches. Win con: Granbull cleans weakened final two w/ Intimidate + boosts.\n\nCelebi special set (Psychic, likely Recover/Giga Drain); predict Recover this turn post-Taunt end, tank w/ Granbull Bulk Up. Sun ending soon, favors if Kyogre last (weaken Water Spouts). Last mon unknown: EQ for potential Ground/Steel/Rock, Return STAB for neutrals. If Celebi heals, alternate Bulk Up/Return; sac Misdreavus trap if setup threat. Gengar revenge for finals if needed. Win con: +2 Granbull sweeps weakened duo."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Misdreavus has fainted, requiring a switch. Opponent's Celebi is at full HP with -1 Atk (irrelevant for its special Psychic), and Taunt has ended, so it may Recover, Giga Drain, or attack.

Granbull (50% HP) is neutral to Psychic, can tank another hit (previous dealt ~44%), and its Intimidate already applied on switch last turn. Plan: Switch to Granbull, then Bulk Up to +1 Atk/Def, allowing it to threaten Celebi with boosted Return (STAB neutral) or Earthquake (if coverage needed). Preserve Gengar for revenge killing the last mon (likely Kyogre/Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Hazards (1 Spikes) cost ~12% on switch, manageable.

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed.\n\nGroudon at 38% brn, physical set (EQ/SD likely); Ice Punch expected to KO, gaining free faint. Sun est. 2 turns left post-this. Post-KO, anticipate Kyogre switch (T-Bolt revenge, as sun weakens Water but Gengar resists/neutral); Rayquaza/Mewtwo possible (Ice Punch/Taunt). Preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened rematch; Misdreavus sac trap if setup threat emerges. Momentum with Gengar: Taunt setups, status physicals, coverage kills.\n\nSkarmory (F, full HP) switched in post-Groudon KO; likely defensive pivot w/ Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind, Sturdy possible. Thunderbolt SE chunk expected (high SpA vs mid SpD). Sun ~1-2 turns left (weakens potential Kyogre Water). Opp rem: likely Kyogre (Tbolt revenge), Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Pressure Skarmory, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs endgame; Misdreavus sac trap if setup emerges.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via T-Bolt; hazards (1 Spikes) active—minimize switches (Misdreavus sac only if trap needed, Granbull switch incurs 1/8 ~45 HP loss). Sun ending, favors vs potential Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, Water weakened). Opp final two: Prioritize T-Bolt (Kyogre/Water/Flying), Ice Punch (Rayquaza/Ground/Dragon), Taunt (Mewtwo/setup), Will-O-Wisp (physical threats). Gengar at ~91% post-turn, strong position; pivot to full HP Granbull for Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs endgame weakened team. Win con: Coverage kill threats, then Granbull cleans.\n\nCelebi switched in full HP, Natural Cure (cures status on switch, but irrelevant now); assume special/support set (Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Baton Pass/Lum Berry?). Taunt to deny healing/setup, force suboptimal play. Opponent's last two likely Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water) or Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Gengar near full, pressure with coverage post-Taunt. Granbull full HP for endgame Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs weakened foes; avoid switch (Spikes ~12% loss). Misdreavus low HP sac trap if setup emerges later. Win con: Disrupt Celebi, KO with follow-up, clean with Granbull.\n\nCelebi: special attacker (Psychic confirmed), Taunted (2 turns left); likely support set w/ Recover/Giga Drain but denied. Switched to Granbull to tank hit, preserve Gengar for coverage vs final mon. Opp last mon: high priority Tbolt/Ice Punch targets (Kyogre water weaken sun, Rayquaza dragon). Granbull plan: Bulk Up x1-2 + Return/EQ sweep endgame; Rest if needed. Spikes 1 layer—minimize further switches. Win con: Granbull cleans weakened final two w/ Intimidate + boosts.\n\nCelebi special set (Psychic, likely Recover/Giga Drain); predict Recover this turn post-Taunt end, tank w/ Granbull Bulk Up. Sun ending soon, favors if Kyogre last (weaken Water Spouts). Last mon unknown: EQ for potential Ground/Steel/Rock, Return STAB for neutrals. If Celebi heals, alternate Bulk Up/Return; sac Misdreavus trap if setup threat. Gengar revenge for finals if needed. Win con: +2 Granbull sweeps weakened duo.\n\nCelebi special set confirmed (Psychic ~44% to Granbull); expect Recover/Giga Drain post-Taunt. Granbull setup: Bulk Up turn 14, then Return if Celebi low/threatened, or EQ vs potential Steel/Rock last mon. Gengar revenge for finals (T-Bolt Kyogre, Ice Punch Rayquaza). Opp last mon: Prioritize coverage—EQ steels/electrics, Return neutrals. Win con: +2 Granbull KOs Celebi, sweeps final w/ boosts + Intimidate."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Granbull is at critically low HP and likely to be KO'd by Celebi's Psychic this turn, as it deals approximately 159 damage, matching current HP. Celebi is faster and has only revealed Psychic as a special attacking move, making an attack probable over recovery (already full HP) or setup like Leech Seed. However, damage rolls have variance (typically 85-100% of calculated), giving ~10% chance Granbull survives for a free Bulk Up setup. Even if KO'd, choosing Bulk Up positions for potential survival and aligns with Granbull's role as a setup sweeper for endgame. If survived, next turn +1 Atk/Def allows Return to chunk or KO Celebi (neutral STAB, high base Atk). Switching to Gengar yields the same outcome (fainted Granbull, Gengar sent in post-move) but Gengar would be too frail to KO Celebi next turn (T-Bolt/Ice Punch ~40-60% damage, then KO'd). Earthquake/Return would execute if survived but no setup value; Rest unnecessary. Optimal risk for reward: attempt setup to enable +2 sweep vs Celebi and final unknown mon (EQ for Rock/Steel/Electric, Return for others). Sun ending this upkeep, weakening any Kyogre-like last mon.", "action": "bulkup", "scratchpad": "Attempting Bulk Up vs likely Psychic; low survival chance but enables sweep if rolls low or opp uses non-damaging move (e.g., Leech Seed).

Gengar backup chip with T-Bolt (neutral) or Ice Punch (SE on Grass but physical weak) if Granbull falls, but expect loss 1v2.

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed.\n\nGroudon at 38% brn, physical set (EQ/SD likely); Ice Punch expected to KO, gaining free faint. Sun est. 2 turns left post-this. Post-KO, anticipate Kyogre switch (T-Bolt revenge, as sun weakens Water but Gengar resists/neutral); Rayquaza/Mewtwo possible (Ice Punch/Taunt). Preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened rematch; Misdreavus sac trap if setup threat emerges. Momentum with Gengar: Taunt setups, status physicals, coverage kills.\n\nSkarmory (F, full HP) switched in post-Groudon KO; likely defensive pivot w/ Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind, Sturdy possible. Thunderbolt SE chunk expected (high SpA vs mid SpD). Sun ~1-2 turns left (weakens potential Kyogre Water). Opp rem: likely Kyogre (Tbolt revenge), Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Pressure Skarmory, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs endgame; Misdreavus sac trap if setup emerges.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via T-Bolt; hazards (1 Spikes) active—minimize switches (Misdreavus sac only if trap needed, Granbull switch incurs 1/8 ~45 HP loss). Sun ending, favors vs potential Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, Water weakened). Opp final two: Prioritize T-Bolt (Kyogre/Water/Flying), Ice Punch (Rayquaza/Ground/Dragon), Taunt (Mewtwo/setup), Will-O-Wisp (physical threats). Gengar at ~91% post-turn, strong position; pivot to full HP Granbull for Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs endgame weakened team. Win con: Coverage kill threats, then Granbull cleans.\n\nCelebi switched in full HP, Natural Cure (cures status on switch, but irrelevant now); assume special/support set (Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Baton Pass/Lum Berry?). Taunt to deny healing/setup, force suboptimal play. Opponent's last two likely Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water) or Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Gengar near full, pressure with coverage post-Taunt. Granbull full HP for endgame Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs weakened foes; avoid switch (Spikes ~12% loss). Misdreavus low HP sac trap if setup emerges later. Win con: Disrupt Celebi, KO with follow-up, clean with Granbull.\n\nCelebi: special attacker (Psychic confirmed), Taunted (2 turns left); likely support set w/ Recover/Giga Drain but denied. Switched to Granbull to tank hit, preserve Gengar for coverage vs final mon. Opp last mon: high priority Tbolt/Ice Punch targets (Kyogre water weaken sun, Rayquaza dragon). Granbull plan: Bulk Up x1-2 + Return/EQ sweep endgame; Rest if needed. Spikes 1 layer—minimize further switches. Win con: Granbull cleans weakened final two w/ Intimidate + boosts.\n\nCelebi special set (Psychic, likely Recover/Giga Drain); predict Recover this turn post-Taunt end, tank w/ Granbull Bulk Up. Sun ending soon, favors if Kyogre last (weaken Water Spouts). Last mon unknown: EQ for potential Ground/Steel/Rock, Return STAB for neutrals. If Celebi heals, alternate Bulk Up/Return; sac Misdreavus trap if setup threat. Gengar revenge for finals if needed. Win con: +2 Granbull sweeps weakened duo.\n\nCelebi special set confirmed (Psychic ~44% to Granbull); expect Recover/Giga Drain post-Taunt. Granbull setup: Bulk Up turn 14, then Return if Celebi low/threatened, or EQ vs potential Steel/Rock last mon. Gengar revenge for finals (T-Bolt Kyogre, Ice Punch Rayquaza). Opp last mon: Prioritize coverage—EQ steels/electrics, Return neutrals. Win con: +2 Granbull KOs Celebi, sweeps final w/ boosts + Intimidate.\n\nAttempting Bulk Up vs likely Psychic; low survival chance but enables sweep if rolls low or opp uses non-damaging move (e.g., Leech Seed). If survive, Return next to pressure Celebi (~60-80% with +1, Intimidate -2 Atk on physical last mon). Gengar backup chip with T-Bolt (neutral) or Ice Punch (SE on Grass but physical weak) if Granbull falls, but expect loss 1v2. Last mon predictions: Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water), Rayquaza (Ice Punch SE), Mewtwo (Taunt/Wisp). Prioritize Granbull survival/setup for win con."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Granbull has fainted at the start of turn 15, leaving Gengar as the only remaining Pokémon at 21% HP (68/323). With no other options, we must switch in Gengar to continue the battle. Celebi is at full health with -2 Attack (irrelevant as it's a special attacker using Psychic). Gengar outspeeds Celebi and, upon entering, can immediately Taunt to prevent recovery or status moves like Leech Seed, then use Thunderbolt for neutral-but-resisted chip damage or Ice Punch for neutral physical damage. However, Celebi's Psychic is super effective on Gengar and will likely KO it on the next hit given its low HP. This is a desperate 1v2 situation; aim to disrupt Celebi and potentially revenge the final unknown Pokémon (predicted Kyogre for Thunderbolt, Rayquaza for Ice Punch, or Mewtwo for Taunt/Thunderbolt).

Likely fast attacker with Psycho Boost or coverage. After Mean Look + Perish Song, switch to Lugia for stall with Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind. Watch for Deoxys coverage moves like Shadow Ball. Team plan: Use Misdreavus trap to remove threats, preserve Lugia as wall, Gengar for offense, Granbull as physical breaker.\n\nExecuted Perish Song on turn 2; Deoxys perish count at 3, Misdreavus to switch next turn. Monitor Deoxys damage output vs Lugia (likely Psycho Boost/Thunderbolt); Lugia can Toxic for chip and Recover to stall. Preserve Gengar/Granbull for later threats. Opponent may switch into Perish Song if possible, but trap prevents.\n\nSwitched to Lugia to stall Deoxys. Deoxys moves: Thunderbolt (special). Anticipate ~3 hits to Lugia (low damage, ~20-30% each); Lugia Toxic turn 4, Recover as needed. Sacrifice Misdreavus for Deoxys removal. Post-Deoxys: Preserve Gengar for revenge kills, Granbull for physical threats. Opponent likely switches to counter Lugia after, prepare Whirlwind/Toxic stall.\n\nDeoxys trapped, Perish 2 entering turn 4; will Toxic to poison, expect Thunderbolt hit, then Recover turn 5. Deoxys likely Normal form special attacker (Thunderbolt coverage); watch for switch-in after Perish KO. Lugia stall core vs next threat; Misdreavus low HP, sac for another trap if needed. Gengar for special threats, Granbull physical wallbreaker.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker w/ Thunderbolt (likely Normal form, Pressure); OHKO'd via Gengar Tbolt on turn 5. Opponent's next switch unknown—watch for Ubers like Kyogre/Groudon/Mewtwo; Gengar can Will-O-Wisp status or Ice Punch Grounds/Dragons, Taunt setups. Misdreavus 26%—sac for trap if needed later. Granbull preserved for Bulk Up sweeping vs weakened team. Early Lugia loss hurts stall, pivot to offense w/ Gengar momentum gain.\n\nDeoxys likely switching out to avoid Perish; expect Ubers like Groudon (switch to Ice Punch next if survives), Kyogre (T-Bolt OHKOs), or Mewtwo (neutral damage). Gengar core attacker now with Lugia down—use Taunt on setups, Will-O-Wisp physicals, Ice Punch dragons/grounds. Next target: Weaken switch-in, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep if opp team weakened. Watch for opponent's remaining threats; assume standard Ubers core.\n\nGroudon switched in post-Deoxys, activated Drought (sun for 5 turns). Assume physical set (Swords Dance/Choice Band possible); burn cripples it. Watch for Fire moves in sun (neutral to Gengar). Opp remaining: likely Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt weak? No, Gengar resists Water), Mewtwo, or Rayquaza. After Wisp, Taunt if setup or Ice Punch if Dragon/Ground. Granbull Earthquake weak to Groudon EQ but Intimidate helps; save for later sweep. Misdreavus low HP for sac trap.\n\nGroudon physical set confirmed (EQ), Drought sun active (4 turns left post-upkeep). Retry burn to cripple; if misses again, consider Ice Punch for damage next. Post-burn, chip with T-Bolt or pivot to Granbull (Intimidate lowers Atk further, Bulk Up for sweep). Misdreavus sac potential for trap later. Opp remaining likely include Kyogre (counter sun, T-Bolt revenge), Rayquaza (Ice Punch), Mewtwo (Taunt). Preserve momentum with Gengar.\n\nGroudon: Confirmed physical set (EQ, likely Swords Dance/Stone Edge/Fire Punch), burned (halves Atk), Drought sun (est. 3 turns left). Ice Punch chips ~30-40% expected (super eff, physical but Gengar's Atk sufficient). Opp may switch to water/dragon counter (e.g., Kyogre: T-Bolt revenge kill; Rayquaza: Ice Punch weak spot). If Groudon stays, continue chipping or Taunt if setup predicted. Post-Groudon, pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs remaining threats. Watch for opponent's last two mons: likely Kyogre (sun-weakened) and Mewtwo/Rayquaza. Misdreavus sac trap option if needed.\n\nGroudon at 38% brn, physical set (EQ/SD likely); Ice Punch expected to KO, gaining free faint. Sun est. 2 turns left post-this. Post-KO, anticipate Kyogre switch (T-Bolt revenge, as sun weakens Water but Gengar resists/neutral); Rayquaza/Mewtwo possible (Ice Punch/Taunt). Preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened rematch; Misdreavus sac trap if setup threat emerges. Momentum with Gengar: Taunt setups, status physicals, coverage kills.\n\nSkarmory (F, full HP) switched in post-Groudon KO; likely defensive pivot w/ Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind, Sturdy possible. Thunderbolt SE chunk expected (high SpA vs mid SpD). Sun ~1-2 turns left (weakens potential Kyogre Water). Opp rem: likely Kyogre (Tbolt revenge), Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Pressure Skarmory, then pivot to Granbull Bulk Up sweep vs endgame; Misdreavus sac trap if setup emerges.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via T-Bolt; hazards (1 Spikes) active—minimize switches (Misdreavus sac only if trap needed, Granbull switch incurs 1/8 ~45 HP loss). Sun ending, favors vs potential Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, Water weakened). Opp final two: Prioritize T-Bolt (Kyogre/Water/Flying), Ice Punch (Rayquaza/Ground/Dragon), Taunt (Mewtwo/setup), Will-O-Wisp (physical threats). Gengar at ~91% post-turn, strong position; pivot to full HP Granbull for Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs endgame weakened team. Win con: Coverage kill threats, then Granbull cleans.\n\nCelebi switched in full HP, Natural Cure (cures status on switch, but irrelevant now); assume special/support set (Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Baton Pass/Lum Berry?). Taunt to deny healing/setup, force suboptimal play. Opponent's last two likely Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water) or Rayquaza/Mewtwo (Ice Punch/Taunt). Gengar near full, pressure with coverage post-Taunt. Granbull full HP for endgame Bulk Up + Return/EQ sweep vs weakened foes; avoid switch (Spikes ~12% loss). Misdreavus low HP sac trap if setup emerges later. Win con: Disrupt Celebi, KO with follow-up, clean with Granbull.\n\nCelebi: special attacker (Psychic confirmed), Taunted (2 turns left); likely support set w/ Recover/Giga Drain but denied. Switched to Granbull to tank hit, preserve Gengar for coverage vs final mon. Opp last mon: high priority Tbolt/Ice Punch targets (Kyogre water weaken sun, Rayquaza dragon). Granbull plan: Bulk Up x1-2 + Return/EQ sweep endgame; Rest if needed. Spikes 1 layer—minimize further switches. Win con: Granbull cleans weakened final two w/ Intimidate + boosts.\n\nCelebi special set (Psychic, likely Recover/Giga Drain); predict Recover this turn post-Taunt end, tank w/ Granbull Bulk Up. Sun ending soon, favors if Kyogre last (weaken Water Spouts). Last mon unknown: EQ for potential Ground/Steel/Rock, Return STAB for neutrals. If Celebi heals, alternate Bulk Up/Return; sac Misdreavus trap if setup threat. Gengar revenge for finals if needed. Win con: +2 Granbull sweeps weakened duo.\n\nCelebi special set confirmed (Psychic ~44% to Granbull); expect Recover/Giga Drain post-Taunt. Granbull setup: Bulk Up turn 14, then Return if Celebi low/threatened, or EQ vs potential Steel/Rock last mon. Gengar revenge for finals (T-Bolt Kyogre, Ice Punch Rayquaza). Opp last mon: Prioritize coverage—EQ steels/electrics, Return neutrals. Win con: +2 Granbull KOs Celebi, sweeps final w/ boosts + Intimidate.\n\nAttempting Bulk Up vs likely Psychic; low survival chance but enables sweep if rolls low or opp uses non-damaging move (e.g., Leech Seed). If survive, Return next to pressure Celebi (~60-80% with +1, Intimidate -2 Atk on physical last mon). Gengar backup chip with T-Bolt (neutral) or Ice Punch (SE on Grass but physical weak) if Granbull falls, but expect loss 1v2. Last mon predictions: Kyogre (T-Bolt revenge, sun-weak Water), Rayquaza (Ice Punch SE), Mewtwo (Taunt/Wisp). Prioritize Granbull survival/setup for win con.\n\nGengar last mon at 21% vs Celebi 100% special set (Psychic, likely Recover/Giga Drain/Leech Seed). Outs peed, plan: Taunt immediate to deny heals/setup, then T-Bolt chip (resisted Electric ~20-30% est.), or Ice Punch alt if physical predicted (neutral). Expect Psychic KO next, but chip/force switch for final revenge: T-Bolt Kyogre (SE Water), Ice Punch Rayquaza (SE Dragon), Taunt/Wisp Mewtwo (setup/physical). 1v2 uphill; win if Celebi switch baited and final weak to coverage."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar is the last Pokémon at 27% HP against Celebi at full HP and one unknown opponent Pokémon, making this a losing 1v2 position. Gengar outspeeds Celebi (base Speed 110 vs. 100) and has no switches available. Celebi is a strong special attacker (Psychic previously dealt ~82% to full-HP Gengar, so it will KO our low-HP Gengar regardless). Taunt would deny Celebi status moves like Recover or Leech Seed next turn, but irrelevant since we faint immediately after. Will-O-Wisp burns Celebi (halving physical Attack, but Celebi is special-based), and Natural Cure would cure it on switch anyway. Ice Punch is super effective (Ice vs. Grass), but physical with Gengar's low Attack (149) vs. higher Defense; estimated ~30-40% damage. Thunderbolt is neutral but leverages Gengar's high Special Attack (298), STAB, and 90-base power; estimated ~45-60% damage based on prior Thunderbolt vs. Skarmory (similar SpD, ~74% first hit).

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches.

Groudon is a major physical threat with Earthquake (super effective on Gengar due to Poison typing) and likely Fire coverage boosted by Drought (neutral on Gengar). Thunderbolt is useless (Ground immune). Ice Punch (physical) won't do significant damage to bulky Groudon. Taunt prevents setup but doesn't immediately cripple physical damage. Will-O-Wisp burns Groudon on the switch-in, halving its Attack to mitigate Earthquake this turn and future threats, allowing better pivoting (e.g., Lugia immune to Ground).

Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?).

Switching Lugia in at low HP risks a super-effective or neutral hit from potential Fire coverage boosted by sun, even if it tanks well. Misdreavus could trap, but better saved for later setups.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar outspeeds Groudon and is immune to its Earthquake due to Levitate. The previous Taunt has just ended after turn 8 upkeep, allowing me to apply Taunt again this turn to prevent Groudon from setting up with Swords Dance or using other non-attacking moves. This keeps Groudon locked into ineffective attacks against Gengar, allowing passive chip from burn while I gain Leftovers recovery and maintain momentum. Thunderbolt would deal neutral damage (~30-40% estimated with Gengar's high SpA), but Taunt is safer for control, especially since sun ends after this turn's upkeep, potentially changing dynamics. Switching Lugia in risks it taking a hit if Groudon switches to something else, and Lugia is low HP; Misdreavus is better saved for trapping later. No need for Will-O-Wisp (already burned) or Ice Punch (no predicted switch to Ground/Dragon yet). Overall, Taunt stalls Groudon out while preserving options.", "action": "taunt", "scratchpad": "Turn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar is active and immune to Groudon's Earthquake due to Levitate. Groudon is Taunted from the previous turn (active through turn 11), so it cannot use status or setup moves and will likely attack with Earthquake again, which is harmless. Will-O-Wisp is redundant since Groudon is already burned, and reapplying Taunt will fail as it's still active. Switching Misdreavus or Lugia risks unnecessary damage if Groudon has coverage, though both are also Ground-immune; however, staying in allows safe chipping. Thunderbolt is the optimal choice: neutral special damage from Gengar's high SpA (298) should chip Groudon for ~30-40% (from 70% to ~30-40%), advancing our stall without risk. Ice Punch is weaker due to Gengar's low Atk. Sun ends after this turn's upkeep, weakening any Fire coverage Groudon might use later. Post-chip, opponent may switch (e.g., to Kyogre, which Thunderbolt handles well); we can respond with status or coverage next turn. This maintains momentum, preserves team health (Lugia needs safe Recover opportunity), and chips the burned, Taunted threat toward KO via burn/status.", "action": "thunderbolt", "scratchpad": "Turn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song.

Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock).

Gengar outspeeds and can reapply Taunt to lock it out of setup moves for another 3 turns (turns 11-13), forcing it back into ineffective Earthquake attacks due to Gengar's Levitate immunity. This buys time to chip with Ice Punch next turn (physical neutral damage, estimated 20-30% given Gengar's modest Atk and Groudon's high Def, bringing it to ~40% post-damage and burn/Leftovers). Will-O-Wisp is redundant (already burned), Thunderbolt is immune. Switching to Lugia (low HP) risks if Groudon has Fire/Stone Edge coverage (neutral to super effective), and to Misdreavus would expose it unnecessarily when Gengar can handle this safely.

Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk.

Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks.

Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO).

Will-O-Wisp has already burned Groudon, halving its Attack and causing passive chip. Thunderbolt is ineffective (Electric immunity on Ground-type). Taunt will fail as it's already applied. Switching out risks Lugia (low HP, vulnerable) or wasting Misdreavus's trapping utility early. Ice Punch provides neutral physical chip damage on Groudon (~15-25% estimated based on Gengar's modest Atk vs. Groudon's solid Def), further wearing it down to force a switch or eventual KO, while preserving momentum.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Groudon is at critically low 8% HP and burned, with Taunt still active for this turn (ends after upkeep). Gengar outspeeds and is immune to Earthquake via Levitate, allowing a safe KO.

Thunderbolt is immune due to Ground typing; Will-O-Wisp redundant as it's already burned; Taunt unnecessary as it's already taunted. Post-KO, opponent will switch in their last Pokémon (likely Kyogre, Mewtwo, or Rayquaza based on Uber meta).

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Turn 14: Gengar vs fresh Skarmory switch-in after Groudon KO.

Taunt is optimal to prevent setup/hazards/phazing, locking Skarmory into attacks only. This buys time to chip safely or pivot. Will-O-Wisp burns could cripple physical threats but Taunt takes priority to deny utility. Avoid switching Lugia (low 20% HP, risky vs unknown coverage like Brave Bird).

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Skarmory is currently taunted from the previous turn, preventing it from using utility moves like Spikes or Roost. Gengar's high speed ensures it moves first. Will-O-Wisp will burn Skarmory, halving its physical attack (crucial for a defensive/physical Skarmory set) and applying chip damage over time, synergizing with the Taunt to fully lock it out of utility. Thunderbolt is neutral on Skarmory, Ice Punch neutral, so burn is the best immediate play to weaken it. If opponent switches, Will-O-Wisp fails but positions for coverage next turn (Thunderbolt for Kyogre, Ice Punch for Rayquaza). No need to reapply Taunt yet as it's active for at least this turn. Switching Lugia risks low HP exposure; Misdreavus can trap later.", "action": "willowisp", "scratchpad": "Skarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Skarmory's Taunt has just ended at the end of turn 15, allowing it to potentially set Spikes, Roost, or Whirlwind this turn. Gengar's Speed (308) outspeeds Skarmory (base 70), so we can act first. Reapplying Taunt locks out its utility moves for the next 3 turns (16-18), preventing hazard setup or recovery/phazing while we position for a burn attempt next or switch safely. Will-O-Wisp risks another miss (85% accuracy) and leaves us open to a potential Brave Bird or Iron Head if Skarmory attacks. Thunderbolt or Ice Punch would chip minimally against Skarmory's bulk (Thunderbolt ~20-30% est. with high SpA, but Ice Punch physical and weak). Switching risks Pursuit super-effective damage on our Ghosts (Gengar/Misdreavus) or hits Lugia's low 20% HP hard (Flying moves super effective). Staying in and Taunting maintains control, allowing a follow-up Will-O-Wisp next turn or pivot to Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind once locked.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift.

Burning Skarmory cripples its physical role, reducing threats like Brave Bird from ~50-70% damage to ~25-35% on Gengar (est. based on stats).

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority).

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority). Win con: Status lock/cripple all threats, recover Lugia for wall, trap last mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nTurn 18: Thunderbolt chip on Skarmory to ~60-70% post-upkeep/burn; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next reapply if needed to deny Roost/Whirlwind. Opponent final threats likely: Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunderbolt OHKO priority), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super/Wisp burn). If switch after chip, coverage follow-up. Lugia: Switch post-Taunt reapply for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon/Steel neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for trapping endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall/burn/cripple all threats with status, chip with Gengar coverage, wall/recover with Lugia, trap final mon with Misdreavus for victory."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Skarmory is at critically low HP (10%) and burned, making it highly vulnerable.

Using Thunderbolt will super effectively KO Skarmory due to its Flying typing, forcing the opponent to send out their final Pokémon (likely Kyogre, Mewtwo, or Rayquaza). This positions Gengar to respond with appropriate coverage next turn: Thunderbolt for Kyogre (super effective), Ice Punch for Rayquaza (super effective), or Taunt for Mewtwo setup.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority). Win con: Status lock/cripple all threats, recover Lugia for wall, trap last mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nTurn 18: Thunderbolt chip on Skarmory to ~60-70% post-upkeep/burn; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next reapply if needed to deny Roost/Whirlwind. Opponent final threats likely: Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunderbolt OHKO priority), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super/Wisp burn). If switch after chip, coverage follow-up. Lugia: Switch post-Taunt reapply for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon/Steel neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for trapping endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall/burn/cripple all threats with status, chip with Gengar coverage, wall/recover with Lugia, trap final mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via Thunderbolt; final opponent mon incoming (likely Kyogre: Drizzle/SW, prioritize Thunderbolt OHKO; Mewtwo: CM setup, Taunt to lock; Rayquaza: SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super effective + potential WoW if not burned). Weather: Sun ended post-turn 18; possible Drizzle if Kyogre. Lugia: Position post-KO for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs final threat if matchup favorable (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral, avoid Electric/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate final sweeper if it sets up.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority). Win con: Status lock/cripple all threats, recover Lugia for wall, trap last mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nTurn 18: Thunderbolt chip on Skarmory to ~60-70% post-upkeep/burn; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next reapply if needed to deny Roost/Whirlwind. Opponent final threats likely: Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunderbolt OHKO priority), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super/Wisp burn). If switch after chip, coverage follow-up. Lugia: Switch post-Taunt reapply for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon/Steel neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for trapping endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall/burn/cripple all threats with status, chip with Gengar coverage, wall/recover with Lugia, trap final mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via Thunderbolt; final opponent mon incoming (likely Kyogre: Drizzle/SW, prioritize Thunderbolt OHKO; Mewtwo: CM setup, Taunt to lock; Rayquaza: SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super effective + potential WoW if not burned). Weather: Sun ended post-turn 18; possible Drizzle if Kyogre. Lugia: Position post-KO for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs final threat if matchup favorable (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral, avoid Electric/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate final sweeper if it sets up. Win con: Coverage KO or status lock final threat with Gengar, recover/wall with Lugia, trap with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi: Natural Cure, unknown item, likely special setup (CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Earth Power) or attacker; Taunt locks out utility/setup. Gengar immunes Psychic STAB, chip with Ice Punch super on Grass next. Opponent likely final or near-final mon; watch for switch to unknown threats, but status Natural Cure limits poison/burn stick. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch chip (~40-50% est.), repeat if needed. Lugia: Position post-lock for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs. attacking Celebi (tanks Grass/Ground immune/neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song if Celebi sets up post-Taunt expiry or for any remaining sweeper. Win con: Taunt-lock/chip Celebi, wall with Lugia Toxic stall, trap final threats with Misdreavus for victory."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar is at 24% HP and will be OHKO'd by another Psychic from Celebi, as the previous one dealt ~82% damage.

Misdreavus resists Psychic (Ghost typing) and is at full HP with solid SpD, making it a safe switch-in to tank the hit. Lugia is at 20% and would likely faint to a neutral Psychic hit.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority). Win con: Status lock/cripple all threats, recover Lugia for wall, trap last mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nTurn 18: Thunderbolt chip on Skarmory to ~60-70% post-upkeep/burn; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next reapply if needed to deny Roost/Whirlwind. Opponent final threats likely: Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunderbolt OHKO priority), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super/Wisp burn). If switch after chip, coverage follow-up. Lugia: Switch post-Taunt reapply for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon/Steel neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for trapping endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall/burn/cripple all threats with status, chip with Gengar coverage, wall/recover with Lugia, trap final mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via Thunderbolt; final opponent mon incoming (likely Kyogre: Drizzle/SW, prioritize Thunderbolt OHKO; Mewtwo: CM setup, Taunt to lock; Rayquaza: SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super effective + potential WoW if not burned). Weather: Sun ended post-turn 18; possible Drizzle if Kyogre. Lugia: Position post-KO for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs final threat if matchup favorable (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral, avoid Electric/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate final sweeper if it sets up. Win con: Coverage KO or status lock final threat with Gengar, recover/wall with Lugia, trap with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi: Natural Cure, unknown item, likely special setup (CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Earth Power) or attacker; Taunt locks out utility/setup. Gengar immunes Psychic STAB, chip with Ice Punch super on Grass next. Opponent likely final or near-final mon; watch for switch to unknown threats, but status Natural Cure limits poison/burn stick. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch chip (~40-50% est.), repeat if needed. Lugia: Position post-lock for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs. attacking Celebi (tanks Grass/Ground immune/neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song if Celebi sets up post-Taunt expiry or for any remaining sweeper. Win con: Taunt-lock/chip Celebi, wall with Lugia Toxic stall, trap final threats with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (base 100 SpA, chunks Gengar super effective); likely CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Earth Power set, but Taunt locks utility (active turns 20-22). Natural Cure limits status stickiness. Opponent last mon unknown (possible Kyogre: Misdreavus weak to Water but can Taunt/Perish; Mewtwo: Taunt lock; Rayquaza: Ghost immune to Dragon, Perish trap). Misdreavus switch to tank Psychic (resisted); follow with Mean Look to trap, then Perish Song for forced switch or 3-turn KO. If Celebi switches post-Mean Look, Perish on incoming threat. Preserve Gengar at 24% for late utility (Wisp/Taunt/coverage); Lugia at 20% for emergency wall/Recover if safe. Win con: Trap final threat(s) with Misdreavus Mean Look + Perish Song, status/chip with Gengar, wall remnants with low-HP Lugia if needed."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Celebi is the likely final opponent Pokémon, given the fainted Deoxys, Groudon, and Skarmory. It has been Taunted from turn 20, which expires after this turn's upkeep, preventing setup or recovery this turn. Misdreavus, with high Special Defense (231) and neutral to Psychic, can comfortably tank another Psychic hit, estimated to leave it at around 40-50% HP based on previous damage (65% from full). Mean Look traps Celebi, preventing any switch to an unseen threat. Next turn, Perish Song will force a 3-turn countdown; even if Celebi Recovers post-Taunt expiry, it will die from Perish Song on turn 25 without escaping the trap. This secures the win without risking low-HP Gengar or Lugia.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority). Win con: Status lock/cripple all threats, recover Lugia for wall, trap last mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nTurn 18: Thunderbolt chip on Skarmory to ~60-70% post-upkeep/burn; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next reapply if needed to deny Roost/Whirlwind. Opponent final threats likely: Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunderbolt OHKO priority), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super/Wisp burn). If switch after chip, coverage follow-up. Lugia: Switch post-Taunt reapply for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon/Steel neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for trapping endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall/burn/cripple all threats with status, chip with Gengar coverage, wall/recover with Lugia, trap final mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via Thunderbolt; final opponent mon incoming (likely Kyogre: Drizzle/SW, prioritize Thunderbolt OHKO; Mewtwo: CM setup, Taunt to lock; Rayquaza: SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super effective + potential WoW if not burned). Weather: Sun ended post-turn 18; possible Drizzle if Kyogre. Lugia: Position post-KO for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs final threat if matchup favorable (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral, avoid Electric/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate final sweeper if it sets up. Win con: Coverage KO or status lock final threat with Gengar, recover/wall with Lugia, trap with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi: Natural Cure, unknown item, likely special setup (CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Earth Power) or attacker; Taunt locks out utility/setup. Gengar immunes Psychic STAB, chip with Ice Punch super on Grass next. Opponent likely final or near-final mon; watch for switch to unknown threats, but status Natural Cure limits poison/burn stick. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch chip (~40-50% est.), repeat if needed. Lugia: Position post-lock for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs. attacking Celebi (tanks Grass/Ground immune/neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song if Celebi sets up post-Taunt expiry or for any remaining sweeper. Win con: Taunt-lock/chip Celebi, wall with Lugia Toxic stall, trap final threats with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (base 100 SpA, chunks Gengar super effective); likely CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Earth Power set, but Taunt locks utility (active turns 20-22). Natural Cure limits status stickiness. Opponent last mon unknown (possible Kyogre: Misdreavus weak to Water but can Taunt/Perish; Mewtwo: Taunt lock; Rayquaza: Ghost immune to Dragon, Perish trap). Misdreavus switch to tank Psychic (resisted); follow with Mean Look to trap, then Perish Song for forced switch or 3-turn KO. If Celebi switches post-Mean Look, Perish on incoming threat. Preserve Gengar at 24% for late utility (Wisp/Taunt/coverage); Lugia at 20% for emergency wall/Recover if safe. Win con: Trap final threat(s) with Misdreavus Mean Look + Perish Song, status/chip with Gengar, wall remnants with low-HP Lugia if needed.\n\nCelebi trapped via Mean Look turn 22; Perish Song turn 23 forces 3-turn KO (dies turn 25 even with Recover). Misdreavus tanks Psychic this turn (~40-50% post-damage/LO), then Perish; Protect turn 24 if needed to stall. Win con: Trap + Perish Song eliminates final threat for victory. No remaining opponent mons expected; preserve low-HP Gengar/Lugia unnecessary."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Celebi is trapped by Mean Look and at full HP, but Perish Song will apply a 3-turn countdown to it.

On turn 24, switch Misdreavus out to reset its own Perish counter, allowing it to avoid fainting while Celebi dies trapped. This secures the KO on the final opponent Pokémon for victory.

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority). Win con: Status lock/cripple all threats, recover Lugia for wall, trap last mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nTurn 18: Thunderbolt chip on Skarmory to ~60-70% post-upkeep/burn; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next reapply if needed to deny Roost/Whirlwind. Opponent final threats likely: Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunderbolt OHKO priority), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super/Wisp burn). If switch after chip, coverage follow-up. Lugia: Switch post-Taunt reapply for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon/Steel neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for trapping endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall/burn/cripple all threats with status, chip with Gengar coverage, wall/recover with Lugia, trap final mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via Thunderbolt; final opponent mon incoming (likely Kyogre: Drizzle/SW, prioritize Thunderbolt OHKO; Mewtwo: CM setup, Taunt to lock; Rayquaza: SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super effective + potential WoW if not burned). Weather: Sun ended post-turn 18; possible Drizzle if Kyogre. Lugia: Position post-KO for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs final threat if matchup favorable (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral, avoid Electric/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate final sweeper if it sets up. Win con: Coverage KO or status lock final threat with Gengar, recover/wall with Lugia, trap with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi: Natural Cure, unknown item, likely special setup (CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Earth Power) or attacker; Taunt locks out utility/setup. Gengar immunes Psychic STAB, chip with Ice Punch super on Grass next. Opponent likely final or near-final mon; watch for switch to unknown threats, but status Natural Cure limits poison/burn stick. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch chip (~40-50% est.), repeat if needed. Lugia: Position post-lock for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs. attacking Celebi (tanks Grass/Ground immune/neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song if Celebi sets up post-Taunt expiry or for any remaining sweeper. Win con: Taunt-lock/chip Celebi, wall with Lugia Toxic stall, trap final threats with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (base 100 SpA, chunks Gengar super effective); likely CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Earth Power set, but Taunt locks utility (active turns 20-22). Natural Cure limits status stickiness. Opponent last mon unknown (possible Kyogre: Misdreavus weak to Water but can Taunt/Perish; Mewtwo: Taunt lock; Rayquaza: Ghost immune to Dragon, Perish trap). Misdreavus switch to tank Psychic (resisted); follow with Mean Look to trap, then Perish Song for forced switch or 3-turn KO. If Celebi switches post-Mean Look, Perish on incoming threat. Preserve Gengar at 24% for late utility (Wisp/Taunt/coverage); Lugia at 20% for emergency wall/Recover if safe. Win con: Trap final threat(s) with Misdreavus Mean Look + Perish Song, status/chip with Gengar, wall remnants with low-HP Lugia if needed.\n\nCelebi trapped via Mean Look turn 22; Perish Song turn 23 forces 3-turn KO (dies turn 25 even with Recover). Misdreavus tanks Psychic this turn (~40-50% post-damage/LO), then Perish; Protect turn 24 if needed to stall. Win con: Trap + Perish Song eliminates final threat for victory. No remaining opponent mons expected; preserve low-HP Gengar/Lugia unnecessary.\n\nPerish Song applied turn 23; Celebi trapped, dies end of turn 25. Plan: Turn 24, switch Misdreavus out (to Gengar/Lugia) to reset counter, Celebi takes damage but can't escape. Turn 25: Celebi faints, victory.

Lugia is the safer switch-in due to its high bulk (hp 416, def 369, spd 344) and resistance to Psychic (likely STAB from Celebi), tanking any attack better than Gengar (which takes super effective Psychic).

No item known. My team utility-focused: Misdreavus for trapping, Gengar for status/offense, Granbull physical. Prioritize Lugia walling, Toxic key threats, preserve for late-game sweep checks.\n\nDeoxys confirmed special attacker with Thunderbolt. Lugia tanks well; monitor for Psychic or other coverage. Potential switches from opponent after Toxic. Prioritize poisoning key threats like Deoxys to control pace.\n\nDeoxys likely Speed form (base Spe 190, outspeeds Lugia; frail HP/Def/SpD base 50). Offensive special set with Thunderbolt confirmed; predict Psychic STAB next. No Lum Berry evident (Toxic stuck). Granbull switch tanks neutral TB, then Return likely chunks/OHKOs Deoxys. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping later threats, Gengar for status on physical sweepers. Lugia Recover post-switch if needed. Watch for Deoxys coverage (Ice Beam/Fire Blast?). Opponent team unknown beyond Deoxys.\n\nDeoxys at 82% TOX, frail to physical; Return likely KO or heavy damage. If survives, follow with Earthquake (Ground neutral but strong). Preserve Lugia Recover; Misdreavus trap if Deoxys switches to another threat. Gengar for Will-O-Wisp on potential physical sweepers. Opponent may sac Deoxys or switch to counter Normal (e.g., Fighting type). Monitor for Deoxys coverage like Psychic/Ice Beam on switch-in.\n\nDeoxys set confirmed: Pressure, special attacker with Thunderbolt and Superpower (physical coverage); likely Speed form, outspeeds most team. Frail to special attacks; OHKO'd by Gengar Thunderbolt. Poison damage accumulating (3/16 this turn ~18%, to ~64% post-turn if survives). Opponent may switch out Deoxys to preserve it; watch for common Ubers like Groudon/Kyogre/Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look/Perish Song on setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza, Slaking). Lugia at low HP: position for safe Recover against non-Electric/ Rock/Ice. Gengar post-KO: use Will-O-Wisp on physical threats, Taunt setups, or pivot with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch coverage.\n\nDeoxys KO'd via Thunderbolt; expect opponent switch to another Ubers threat (e.g., Kyogre, Groudon, Mewtwo, Rayquaza). Gengar remains healthy post-KO; use Will-O-Wisp on physical sweepers like Groudon/Rayquaza, Taunt on setup (e.g., Mewtwo Calm Mind), coverage with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for waters/dragons. Lugia low HP: switch only to safe Recover targets (avoid Electric/Dark/Ghost/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus ready for Mean Look trap on setup sweepers or Perish Song to force switches. Overall strategy: status control with Toxic/Wisp/Taunt, preserve walls for late-game.\n\nGroudon: Drought ability, full HP, likely physical set (EQ, Fire Punch/Fire Blast, SD/Stone Edge possible); burn applied turn 6 to halve Atk. Sun for 4 turns left. Lugia ideal pivot vs Groudon (Ground immune, tanks Fire). Misdreavus trap potential setups post-burn. Watch for Groudon coverage/item (Leftovers/Choice Band?). Opponent remaining team: likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza; prepare Taunt/Wisp accordingly. Gengar post-Wisp: pivot out if pressured.\n\nGroudon confirmed physical set with Earthquake; likely Swords Dance/Fire Punch/Stone Edge coverage, but burn cripples Atk. Taunt locks it into attacks. Sun has ~5 turns left post-this (was 6). If Groudon switches, pivot back to Gengar for status or coverage. Lugia Recover opportunity next if safe (e.g., post-Taunt). Watch for opponent remaining: likely watery threats (Kyogre?) or special sweepers (Mewtwo); use Misdreavus Mean Look/Perish Song on them. Gengar healthy, position for late-game utility.\n\nSun has 2 turns left (ends after turn 9 upkeep). Groudon physical set confirmed (EQ, likely SD/Fire Punch/Stone Edge); burn + re-Taunt locks it into ineffective attacks. Next turn, if stays, chip with Thunderbolt (neutral special damage ~30-40%) or Ice Punch if predicts water switch. If switches, pivot Gengar for status/coverage. Lugia at 20%: switch only vs non-threatening moves (e.g., post-Taunt Ground/fire). Misdreavus trap remaining setup threats (e.g., Rayquaza SD, Mewtwo CM) with Mean Look + Perish Song. Opponent remaining: likely Kyogre (water absorb Lugia, Thunderbolt weak), Mewtwo (Taunt), Rayquaza (Wisp/Ice Punch). Overall: status stall Groudon, recover Lugia, trap sweepers late.\n\nTurn 9: Re-Taunt Groudon to lock out SD/setup; sun ends post-upkeep, watch for weather change. Groudon chipped to ~64% post-turn (burn + LO). Position Lugia Recover next turn if safe (post-Taunt, immune to EQ). Opponent likely switches after stall; prepare Gengar Thunderbolt for Kyogre/Mewtwo or Ice Punch for Rayquaza/dragon. Misdreavus for Perish Song trap on endgame sweeper. Win con: status chip threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus, utility from Gengar.\n\nTurn 10: Taunt on Groudon active turns 9-11; safe Thunderbolt chip (~30-40% damage, to ~30-40% HP post-burn/LO). Sun ends post-upkeep, no Drought refresh likely. If Groudon stays, follow with another Thunderbolt or Ice Punch if predicts dragon switch. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt KOs or chunks; to Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage; to Mewtwo, Taunt. Position Lugia for Recover post-Taunt expiry if safe matchup (e.g., vs non-Electric/Fire/Rock). Misdreavus trap endgame sweeper with Mean Look/Perish Song. Win con: Continued status stall/chip on remaining threats (likely Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with Lugia, utility status from Gengar/Misdreavus.\n\nSun ended post-turn 10; no Drought active. Taunt reapplied on Groudon (active turns 11-13), locking out SD/setup. Groudon 63% burned; next Ice Punch chip (~20-30% est., to ~40% post-burn/LO). If switches to Kyogre (likely), Taunt prevents CM/Drizzle setup, Thunderbolt chunks/KOs (Water weak to Electric). To Rayquaza, Ice Punch coverage (Ice super); to Mewtwo, Taunt again. Lugia: position for safe Recover post-Taunt (immune to EQ, tanks Fire neutral) once at higher HP. Misdreavus: reserve for Mean Look/Perish Song on endgame sweeper (e.g., Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall Groudon to low HP, status lock remaining threats, wall with Lugia/Misdreavus utility.\n\nTurn 12: Ice Punch chip on Groudon to ~35-45% post-upkeep; Taunt expires post-turn 13. If switches to Kyogre, follow Thunderbolt (OHKO/chunk potential); Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective; Mewtwo, Taunt to prevent setup. Lugia: switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Recover vs. locked attacks (e.g., EQ immune). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look/Perish Song for endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Chip/stall Groudon low, status lock/chip remaining threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 13: Ice Punch KOs Groudon safely; expect switch to final threat (Kyogre: Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo: Taunt to block CM; Rayquaza: Ice Punch super effective coverage). Taunt expires post-upkeep, sun likely ends soon (Drought not refreshing). Lugia low HP: switch post-KO only if safe (e.g., vs predicted non-Electric/Fire/Rock for Recover). Misdreavus: reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate endgame sweeper. Win con: KO Groudon, status/coverage lock final threat, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap for victory.\n\nSkarmory: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye, Leftovers/Shed Shell, defensive set (Stealth Rock/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird/Drill Peck/Iron Head). Taunt locks hazards/phazing/recovery. Opponent remaining: Likely Kyogre (Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (Taunt block CM), Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage). Sun ends soon; watch weather shift (possible Drizzle if Kyogre). Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Flying neutral, immune Ground). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for endgame sweeper trap. Gengar: Utility status/coverage post-lock. Win con: Deny Skarmory utility, status/chip final threats, wall with Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nSkarmory: Defensive set likely (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Brave Bird); burn cripples physical moves, Taunt denies utility. Taunt expires post-turn 16. Opponent remaining: Kyogre (Drizzle/SW, Thunderbolt OHKO), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super, Wisp burn). Sun ends post-turn 15; possible Drizzle if Kyogre switches. Post-burn, if Skarmory stays/chips low, KO with Thunderbolt. If switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt; Rayquaza, Ice Punch; Mewtwo, Taunt. Lugia: Recover post-Taunt vs locked attacks if safe (tanks Water/Steel/Flying neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap. Win con: Burn/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats (Kyogre/Mewtwo/Rayquaza), wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 16: Taunt reapplied on Skarmory (or switch-in), active turns 16-18; denies Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/SD/CM. Next: Will-O-Wisp if Skarmory stays (burn physical threat); if switches to Kyogre, Thunderbolt OHKO/chunk; Mewtwo, follow Taunt if needed; Rayquaza, Ice Punch super effective. Lugia: Position post-Taunt for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Steel/Water/Psychic neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for endgame sweeper trap (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Sun ends post-turn 16; possible Drizzle shift. Win con: Lock/stall Skarmory, status/chip final threats, wall with recovered Lugia + Misdreavus trap.\n\nTurn 17: WoW retry on Skarmory/switch-in to burn physical threat; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next turn chip with Thunderbolt if survives (neutral ~25-35% damage est.) or coverage if switch (Thunderbolt on Kyogre OHKO potential, Ice Punch on Rayquaza super, Taunt on Mewtwo CM). Lugia: Switch post-Taunt expiry for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs locked attacks (tanks predicted Steel/Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song for trapping final sweeper (Rayquaza SD/Mewtwo CM). Sun ends post-turn 17; watch Drizzle weather shift if Kyogre. Opponent final mon likely: Kyogre (Thunderbolt priority), Mewtwo (Taunt priority), Rayquaza (Ice Punch/Wisp priority). Win con: Status lock/cripple all threats, recover Lugia for wall, trap last mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nTurn 18: Thunderbolt chip on Skarmory to ~60-70% post-upkeep/burn; Taunt expires post-turn 18, so next reapply if needed to deny Roost/Whirlwind. Opponent final threats likely: Kyogre (Drizzle, Thunderbolt OHKO priority), Mewtwo (CM, Taunt lock), Rayquaza (SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super/Wisp burn). If switch after chip, coverage follow-up. Lugia: Switch post-Taunt reapply for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs locked attacks (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon/Steel neutral). Misdreavus: Mean Look + Perish Song reserve for trapping endgame sweeper (Rayquaza/Mewtwo). Win con: Stall/burn/cripple all threats with status, chip with Gengar coverage, wall/recover with Lugia, trap final mon with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nSkarmory KO'd via Thunderbolt; final opponent mon incoming (likely Kyogre: Drizzle/SW, prioritize Thunderbolt OHKO; Mewtwo: CM setup, Taunt to lock; Rayquaza: SD/Mixin, Ice Punch super effective + potential WoW if not burned). Weather: Sun ended post-turn 18; possible Drizzle if Kyogre. Lugia: Position post-KO for safe Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind vs final threat if matchup favorable (tanks Water/Psychic/Dragon neutral, avoid Electric/Rock/Ice). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song to trap and eliminate final sweeper if it sets up. Win con: Coverage KO or status lock final threat with Gengar, recover/wall with Lugia, trap with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi: Natural Cure, unknown item, likely special setup (CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Psychic/Earth Power) or attacker; Taunt locks out utility/setup. Gengar immunes Psychic STAB, chip with Ice Punch super on Grass next. Opponent likely final or near-final mon; watch for switch to unknown threats, but status Natural Cure limits poison/burn stick. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch chip (~40-50% est.), repeat if needed. Lugia: Position post-lock for safe Toxic/Whirlwind/Recover vs. attacking Celebi (tanks Grass/Ground immune/neutral). Misdreavus: Reserve Mean Look + Perish Song if Celebi sets up post-Taunt expiry or for any remaining sweeper. Win con: Taunt-lock/chip Celebi, wall with Lugia Toxic stall, trap final threats with Misdreavus for victory.\n\nCelebi confirmed special attacker with Psychic (base 100 SpA, chunks Gengar super effective); likely CM/Recover/Giga Drain/Earth Power set, but Taunt locks utility (active turns 20-22). Natural Cure limits status stickiness. Opponent last mon unknown (possible Kyogre: Misdreavus weak to Water but can Taunt/Perish; Mewtwo: Taunt lock; Rayquaza: Ghost immune to Dragon, Perish trap). Misdreavus switch to tank Psychic (resisted); follow with Mean Look to trap, then Perish Song for forced switch or 3-turn KO. If Celebi switches post-Mean Look, Perish on incoming threat. Preserve Gengar at 24% for late utility (Wisp/Taunt/coverage); Lugia at 20% for emergency wall/Recover if safe. Win con: Trap final threat(s) with Misdreavus Mean Look + Perish Song, status/chip with Gengar, wall remnants with low-HP Lugia if needed.\n\nCelebi trapped via Mean Look turn 22; Perish Song turn 23 forces 3-turn KO (dies turn 25 even with Recover). Misdreavus tanks Psychic this turn (~40-50% post-damage/LO), then Perish; Protect turn 24 if needed to stall. Win con: Trap + Perish Song eliminates final threat for victory. No remaining opponent mons expected; preserve low-HP Gengar/Lugia unnecessary.\n\nPerish Song applied turn 23; Celebi trapped, dies end of turn 25. Plan: Turn 24, switch Misdreavus out (to Gengar/Lugia) to reset counter, Celebi takes damage but can't escape. Turn 25: Celebi faints, victory.

The opponent leads with Deoxys, likely the Speed form given its role as a fast lead, which outspeeds Misdreavus (spe 222 vs. Deoxys-S base 180 spe ~400). Deoxys commonly carries Taunt to shut down status users like Misdreavus, Spikes for hazards, or strong attacks like Psycho Boost. Committing to Mean Look immediately risks being Taunted first, rendering Misdreavus useless since it has no damaging moves. Perish Song without trapping allows Deoxys to switch out. Therefore, Protect is the optimal scout move: it blocks potential attacks (revealing coverage like Thunderbolt if used), while status moves like Taunt or Spikes will go through but be observed without harm.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats)."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Deoxys is trapped and has consistently used Thunderbolt every turn it's had a chance to attack (4 times now), suggesting it may continue with the safe coverage move rather than risking a Psycho Boost, which would lower its SpA by 2 stages self-destructively while trapped and Toxic'd. Gengar can survive another Thunderbolt (~44% damage, from 62% to ~18%), then retaliate with its own Thunderbolt, which should deal massive damage to frail Speed Deoxys (base 50 SpD, ~82% HP remaining). Given Gengar's high SpA (base 250) vs Deoxys's low defenses, this likely chunks or KOs Deoxys outright, gaining momentum. Will-O-Wisp fails due to existing Toxic status (Gen 3 status exclusivity). Taunt is an option to prevent potential Spikes/Taunt, but prioritizing damage output is better here to remove the threat while it's committed. Switching is risky: Lugia/Misdreavus too low/PAR and weak to Electric; Granbull takes neutral hit but lower SpD and no immediate advantage. Deoxys outspeeds Gengar (base Spe 150 vs 110), so it moves first, but prediction favors survival and counter.", "action": "thunderbolt", "scratchpad": "Will-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing."}, "outcome": "loss", "is_valid_response": true}

Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Groudon is heavily crippled by burn (halving its already Intimidated Atk -1) and sun is up but no Fire move revealed yet. Granbull can safely Bulk Up on a predicted Earthquake, as it tanked one last turn (from full to 268/364, now at 290/364 after LO and can heal more). This sets up +1 Atk/Def, allowing Return to potentially chunk or KO Groudon next turn given high base Atk (372) and STAB. Switching risks free damage or loss of momentum; other mons are low HP/PAR. Post-setup, threaten with Return/EQ while preserving stall tools (Toxic/Whirlwind from Lugia, trap from Misdreavus). Opponent may switch to avoid burn chip, but if they do, Bulk Up still gains free boost against likely next threat (e.g., Rayquaza neutral to Normal).", "action": "bulkup", "scratchpad": "Groudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Granbull is at low HP (23.63%) but has +1 Atk and +1 Def from previous Bulk Up. Groudon's physical Earthquake is neutrally effective but heavily nerfed by burn (-50% Atk), Intimidate (-1 Atk), and Granbull's +1 Def; previous EQ only did ~26% from full HP, so now it should do minimal damage (<10%), easily survivable even at low HP. If Groudon uses Overheat again, it's special and super effective under sun (1.5x), but at -2 SpA (1/2 modifier from original), it should deal roughly 1/3 of the previous ~82% damage (original under sun), around 27%. With Leftovers +6% incoming, Granbull's effective HP is ~30%, so it might survive Overheat barely or trade evenly; however, continuing setup maximizes Granbull's sweeping potential as the win condition. Switching risks low-HP teammates (all ~20-27%, PAR) fainting to Groudon's attacks, and Gengar would be ideal for EQ immunity but vulnerable to potential Fire/Stone Edge. Rest recovers but wastes setup momentum. Thus, Bulk Up for +2 stages, tanking the turn to position for a boosted Return KO/chunk next turn against Groudon's 76% HP.", "action": "bulkup", "scratchpad": "Sun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12.

Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Granbull has fainted at 0 HP, so a switch is mandatory. All remaining Pokémon (Misdreavus, Lugia, Gengar) are immune to Earthquake due to Levitate or Flying typing, making the switch safe against Groudon's primary move. Gengar is the optimal choice: it has no paralysis (unlike Misdreavus and Lugia), the highest remaining HP fraction (~27%), and outspeeds Groudon (Spe 308 vs base 90). This allows Gengar to immediately use Thunderbolt to chip Groudon further (neutral Electric damage, leveraging Gengar's high SpA 298 against Groudon's base SpD 150, estimated ~30-40% damage from 76% HP). Lugia at ~20% HP risks fainting to Overheat (even at -2 SpA under sun boost) or paralysis preventing Recover; Misdreavus is too low HP (~25%, PAR) and better preserved for Mean Look traps on non-Ghost threats like potential Rayquaza. Post-switch, Gengar can follow up with Taunt to prevent Groudon recovery/setup or pivot status on switches. Long-term: Chip Groudon to setup KO, then pivot Lugia for Whirlwind phazing/Recover once safe.", "action": "gengar", "scratchpad": "Sun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun)."}, "outcome": "loss", "is_valid_response": true}

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun)."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar is active at 33% HP, immune to Groudon's Earthquake due to Levitate.

Even if it doesn't (unlikely), Groudon at -4 SpA means Overheat does minimal damage (~10-20% est. under fading sun). Post-KO, opponent reveals last Pokémon (likely Rayquaza or Kyogre). If Rayquaza switches in, Ice Punch super effective next; if Kyogre, sun ending post-turn hurts it, and Gengar can chip with Thunderbolt or Taunt setup.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar and Groudon are in a mutual immunity situation (Thunderbolt immune to Ground, Earthquake immune via Levitate), leading to a stall where neither can damage the other. Groudon is at 63% HP, burned, with -1 Atk and -4 SpA, and will continue losing HP from burn (-6.25% per turn) net of Leftovers (+1.25%), so it will faint in a few turns regardless. Opponent will likely switch to their final Pokémon (suspected Rayquaza physical DD set or possibly Kyogre), as staying achieves nothing. Gengar is fast (Spe 308, outspeeds most Ubers except Deoxys which is fainted) and healthy at 39%, so staying in allows reacting to the switch-in. Taunt is optimal: prevents setup (DD on Rayquaza, Calm Mind on Kyogre/Mewtwo) and forces the opponent to attack, which Gengar can then counter next turn (e.g., WO for physical threats, Thunderbolt for Kyogre). Switching risks taking a hit on low-HP Misdreavus (26% PAR) or Lugia (20% PAR), losing momentum. Post-Taunt, follow with status/damage based on reveal.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar is immune to Groudon's Earthquake due to Levitate and safe here. Thunderbolt is useless (Ground immune to Electric), Will-O-Wisp redundant (already burned), Taunt already active. Ice Punch is the only damaging option to chip Groudon's 57% HP. At -4 SpA, Groudon's Overheat will do minimal damage to Gengar (~10-20% est., survivable with Leftovers). This pressures opponent to switch (likely to Rayquaza/Kyogre), allowing Gengar to momentum into status or coverage next turn (WO for physical, Tbolt for water/dragon).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Groudon is at 11% HP and burned with severe SpA drop (-4), making it unable to threaten effectively.

Ice Punch is super effective (2x) against Ground-type Groudon and will easily KO it from low HP, even with Gengar's modest Attack stat. This removes a major threat, gains momentum, and forces opponent to send in their last Pokémon (likely Rayquaza or Kyogre). Will-O-Wisp is redundant (already burned), Taunt is unnecessary at low HP, and Thunderbolt is ineffective (Ground immunity).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Opponent has switched in Skarmory, a Steel/Flying defensive wall, likely with Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, and a physical attack like Drill Peck.

Thunderbolt is resisted (0.5x), Will-O-Wisp would burn but Skarmory may Roost or attack back, and Taunt prevents setup but doesn't deal damage.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar outspeeds Skarmory significantly (308 Spe vs base 70). Skarmory is at 77% HP after taking an Ice Punch (previous one did ~29% damage), and it's a stall Pokemon likely with Roost for recovery, Whirlwind for phazing, and Spikes (just used). It already set 1 layer of Spikes, which hurts our low-HP reserves (Misdreavus at 26%, Lugia at 20%—switching would drop them critically low even before paralysis risk). Sun is still active but irrelevant here (no Fire/Water moves). Opponent's team: Deoxys (fainted, offensive Electric coverage), Groudon (fainted, physical SD with EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (final mon, stall set). No major threats left; this is a stall war. Gengar's Ice Punch is 4x super effective (SE on Flying, neutral on Steel), but with low Atk (149), it chips ~25-30% per hit. Taunt prevents Roost (healing), further Spikes, and Whirlwind (phazing our setup/reserves). Staying in is better than switching—reserves too low/PAR to reliably wall or act (25% paralysis chance, Spikes 12.5% incoming damage). Taunt this turn locks Skarmory out of utility for 2-3 turns (Gen assumption), forcing it to attack (likely Drill Peck/Brave Bird, neutral on Gengar, survivable ~30-50% est. with Def 167 and Leftovers). Next turns: Ice Punch to chip (aim for KO in 3-4 hits, accounting for its Leftovers but no Roost). If it attacks physically, consider Will-O-Wisp next instead. Reserves as backup: If Gengar chipped low, switch Lugia (resists Steel/Flying) for Recover/Whirlwind despite risks; Misdreavus for potential trap if physical threat but unlikely.

Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant.

Gengar outspeeds and can Will-O-Wisp first to burn Skarmory, halving its Atk immediately before its attack this turn, reducing incoming damage (~10% instead of 20%). This preserves Gengar's HP for multiple Ice Punches (2x SE) to chip Skarmory down over the next 2-3 turns while Taunt prevents recovery. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) are too low to switch safely into physical hits; better to outstall with Gengar as the final mon.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar outspeeds Skarmory and can Taunt it again now that the previous Taunt has ended after turn 18. This prevents Skarmory from using Roost to recover or setting more Spikes/Whirlwind. Skarmory is the last Pokémon at 76% HP and burned (net 0% from burn/Leftovers). Ice Punch is 2x super effective and previously dealt ~29% damage; applying Taunt locks it into attacking (likely Pursuit, ~20-30% damage to Gengar at 50% HP), then I can safely chip with 2-3 Ice Punches next turns to KO while Gengar recovers via Leftovers.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar.\n\nSkarmory final mon at 76% burned, Taunt reapplied turn 19 (lasts turns 20-22). Expect Pursuit/Drill Peck retaliation (~20-30%/hit); Gengar survives multiple while chipping ~25-30%/Ice Punch. Post-Taunt, Ice Punch x2-3 for KO. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) unused—unnecessary with Gengar's control.

Thunderbolt is optimal over Ice Punch as it uses Gengar's high SpA (298) vs low physical Atk (149) for greater neutral damage on Skarmory (Steel/Flying; Electric neutral). Estimated ~40-50% damage, leaving Skarmory low for next-turn KO. Will-O-Wisp redundant (already burned); Taunt unnecessary (already applied, ends post-turn).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar.\n\nSkarmory final mon at 76% burned, Taunt reapplied turn 19 (lasts turns 20-22). Expect Pursuit/Drill Peck retaliation (~20-30%/hit); Gengar survives multiple while chipping ~25-30%/Ice Punch. Post-Taunt, Ice Punch x2-3 for KO. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) unused—unnecessary with Gengar's control. No further threats; focus on finishing.\n\nSkarmory stall set (Spikes, Pursuit, likely Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck); burned and Taunt-locked, physical output minimal (~10-15%/hit). Thunderbolt ~40-50% chunk est.; follow with 1-2 more attacks for KO next turn. Reserves (Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR) unused—preserve for potential future but unnecessary. Opponent team depleted (Deoxys/Groudon/Skarmory fainted); focus on clean finish."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar outspeeds Celebi (Spe 308 > ~299 max). Celebi is the opponent's last Pokémon, likely a bulky special attacker/support with Recover, Psychic, Giga Drain, and possibly status moves like Leech Seed or Toxic.

Taunt is optimal over damaging moves: it denies Celebi's Recover/setup/status for 3 turns without wasting a damaging turn. After Taunt, Celebi's Psychic KOs Gengar; send Lugia (Spikes reduces to 30 HP, LO to 56 HP at upkeep).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar.\n\nSkarmory final mon at 76% burned, Taunt reapplied turn 19 (lasts turns 20-22). Expect Pursuit/Drill Peck retaliation (~20-30%/hit); Gengar survives multiple while chipping ~25-30%/Ice Punch. Post-Taunt, Ice Punch x2-3 for KO. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) unused—unnecessary with Gengar's control. No further threats; focus on finishing.\n\nSkarmory stall set (Spikes, Pursuit, likely Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck); burned and Taunt-locked, physical output minimal (~10-15%/hit). Thunderbolt ~40-50% chunk est.; follow with 1-2 more attacks for KO next turn. Reserves (Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR) unused—preserve for potential future but unnecessary. Opponent team depleted (Deoxys/Groudon/Skarmory fainted); focus on clean finish.\n\nCelebi final mon: bulky special (Psychic/Recover/Giga Drain/Seed?), Natural Cure. Taunt locks utility 3 turns, enabling safe Lugia pivot + Toxic. Stall: Lugia Recover/Toxic vs attacks; Toxic ramps to KO despite Recover (net loss as ticks > heal eventually). Gengar sacced, Misdreavus preserved but unnecessary. No switches possible for opp. Sun 20 turns: boosts Grass but Lugia resists."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gengar has fainted, requiring a switch. Available options are Misdreavus (25% HP, PAR) and Lugia (20% HP, PAR). Opponent's Celebi is at full HP, Taunted (preventing non-attack moves like Recover), and likely to use Psychic (neutral on Misdreavus, super effective on Lugia). 1 layer of Spikes will deal 12.5% on switch-in. Lugia would take Spikes (~12% to ~8% HP) then super effective Psychic, estimated 50-60% damage, resulting in KO. Misdreavus takes Spikes to ~13% HP, then neutral Psychic estimated 25-35% damage (Celebi SpA ~315 vs. Misdreavus SpD 231 and low HP, but Ghost typing neutral and decent bulk), likely surviving at low HP.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar.\n\nSkarmory final mon at 76% burned, Taunt reapplied turn 19 (lasts turns 20-22). Expect Pursuit/Drill Peck retaliation (~20-30%/hit); Gengar survives multiple while chipping ~25-30%/Ice Punch. Post-Taunt, Ice Punch x2-3 for KO. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) unused—unnecessary with Gengar's control. No further threats; focus on finishing.\n\nSkarmory stall set (Spikes, Pursuit, likely Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck); burned and Taunt-locked, physical output minimal (~10-15%/hit). Thunderbolt ~40-50% chunk est.; follow with 1-2 more attacks for KO next turn. Reserves (Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR) unused—preserve for potential future but unnecessary. Opponent team depleted (Deoxys/Groudon/Skarmory fainted); focus on clean finish.\n\nCelebi final mon: bulky special (Psychic/Recover/Giga Drain/Seed?), Natural Cure. Taunt locks utility 3 turns, enabling safe Lugia pivot + Toxic. Stall: Lugia Recover/Toxic vs attacks; Toxic ramps to KO despite Recover (net loss as ticks > heal eventually). Gengar sacced, Misdreavus preserved but unnecessary. No switches possible for opp. Sun 20 turns: boosts Grass but Lugia resists.\n\nSwitched to Misdreavus vs Taunted Celebi. Expect Psychic neutral hit post-Spikes; if survives (~10-15% est.), next Mean Look trap then Perish Song (PAR risk, but locks in 3-turn faint). If KO'd, Lugia final: Recover if safe, Toxic to ramp damage (Taunt blocks Celebi Recover), Whirlwind phaze if setup suspected. Celebi likely Psychic STAB, Giga Drain (sun-boosted neutral), Recover (blocked), utility like Baton Pass/Heal Bell (blocked). Natural Cure irrelevant without status. Win con: Trap Perish Song or Toxic stall-out; Lugia high SpD/Leftovers edges long fight."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Misdreavus outspeeds Celebi even when paralyzed (effective Speed 166 > 105 base). Celebi is Taunted, so it can only attack (likely Psychic, neutral on Misdreavus but potentially KOing at 32% HP). Perish Song is ideal: Misdreavus uses it first, affecting both (Misdreavus and Celebi), starting a 3-turn countdown. Celebi then likely KOs Misdreavus, but the effect lingers on Celebi, forcing it to faint at the end of turn 25 unless it switches (impossible, final mon). Lugia switches in on turn 23, unaffected by Perish Song, and can Recover or stall Celebi's attacks (Psychic resisted 0.5x, low damage expected due to Lugia's high SpD 344 and Celebi's base SpA 100; est. 10-20% per hit to full HP). Spikes (1 layer) will chip Lugia on switch (~12.5% or 52 HP from 82, leaving ~30 HP), but still survivable for 3 turns with Leftovers/Recover. Sun boosts potential Grass moves, but Taunt blocks them. If paralysis prevents Perish Song (25% chance), Celebi KOs, and Lugia pivots to Toxic stall next turn. Perish Song secures the win cleanly without relying on damage calcs. Taunt/Protect/Mean Look less optimal: Taunt redundant, Protect scouts but wastes turn, Mean Look unnecessary (no switch) and delays Perish Song, risking KO before second move.", "action": "perishsong", "scratchpad": "Celebi final mon, likely bulky special set (Psychic/Giga Drain/Recover/utility), Taunted (active turns 22-23/24).

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar.\n\nSkarmory final mon at 76% burned, Taunt reapplied turn 19 (lasts turns 20-22). Expect Pursuit/Drill Peck retaliation (~20-30%/hit); Gengar survives multiple while chipping ~25-30%/Ice Punch. Post-Taunt, Ice Punch x2-3 for KO. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) unused—unnecessary with Gengar's control. No further threats; focus on finishing.\n\nSkarmory stall set (Spikes, Pursuit, likely Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck); burned and Taunt-locked, physical output minimal (~10-15%/hit). Thunderbolt ~40-50% chunk est.; follow with 1-2 more attacks for KO next turn. Reserves (Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR) unused—preserve for potential future but unnecessary. Opponent team depleted (Deoxys/Groudon/Skarmory fainted); focus on clean finish.\n\nCelebi final mon: bulky special (Psychic/Recover/Giga Drain/Seed?), Natural Cure. Taunt locks utility 3 turns, enabling safe Lugia pivot + Toxic. Stall: Lugia Recover/Toxic vs attacks; Toxic ramps to KO despite Recover (net loss as ticks > heal eventually). Gengar sacced, Misdreavus preserved but unnecessary. No switches possible for opp. Sun 20 turns: boosts Grass but Lugia resists.\n\nSwitched to Misdreavus vs Taunted Celebi. Expect Psychic neutral hit post-Spikes; if survives (~10-15% est.), next Mean Look trap then Perish Song (PAR risk, but locks in 3-turn faint). If KO'd, Lugia final: Recover if safe, Toxic to ramp damage (Taunt blocks Celebi Recover), Whirlwind phaze if setup suspected. Celebi likely Psychic STAB, Giga Drain (sun-boosted neutral), Recover (blocked), utility like Baton Pass/Heal Bell (blocked). Natural Cure irrelevant without status. Win con: Trap Perish Song or Toxic stall-out; Lugia high SpD/Leftovers edges long fight.\n\nCelebi final mon, likely bulky special set (Psychic/Giga Drain/Recover/utility), Taunted (active turns 22-23/24). Perish Song forces Celebi faint end turn 25; Lugia (~20% post-Spikes) tanks resisted Psychics (est. 10-20% damage/hit), Recover turn 23-24 if below 50% for safety, Leftovers sustains. No further threats; win secured via trap countdown + stall.\n\nTurn 22: Mean Look to trap Celebi; expect Psychic ~10-15% damage, survive to Perish Song turn 23 (Taunt ends post-22, enabling status moves on 23). If faint, Lugia switch: Toxic for ramping chip (Psychic/Giga Drain resisted, sun-boosts Grass neutral ~20-30%), Recover sustain, Whirlwind phaze setups. Celebi bulky special likely (Psychic STAB, Giga Drain sun-boost, Recover blocked until 23); Natural Cure irrelevant. Win con: Perish trap countdown or Toxic + Leftovers edge; Lugia walls long-term."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Lugia is my last Pokémon at 26% HP, paralyzed, facing Celebi at full HP. Celebi outspeeds due to paralysis reducing Lugia's speed below Celebi's base 100. Celebi's known moves (Psychic, Hidden Power) deal resisted damage to Lugia (Psychic 0.5x; Hidden Power type unknown but likely not super effective). Likely set includes Recover and possibly Giga Drain (resisted 0.5x, sun-boosted but still low damage est. 10-20%/hit). Taunt has ended, so Celebi can Recover now. Optimal play: Toxic immediately to inflict poison, starting ramping damage (6.25% initial, increasing to 12.5%/turn) that outpaces Celebi's recovery over time, especially with Pressure draining PP. Follow with Recover to sustain HP against chip damage and poison on self if any (but none). Whirlwind if setup or pass detected; Reflect unnecessary as threats are special.

Recover Lugia turn 24 if below 50% post-hit/LO. Whirlwind phaze if Baton Pass/setup; else stall. Track damage calcs, moves revealed (e.g., Giga Drain confirms Grass), PP usage.

Stall strategy: phaze with Lugia, status with Gengar/Misdreavus, setup Granbull late. Preserve Misdreavus for trapping non-Ghost sweepers (Ghosts immune to Mean Look in Gen 3). Track revealed moves next turn. Win con: Stall out opponent's offense with Leftovers recovery, Toxic chip, Perish Song on threats.\n\nDeoxys trapped by Mean Look (effective next turn). Expect 30-50% damage from Thunderbolt; monitor exact damage for future calcs. Plan Perish Song turn 3 unless KO'd. Opponent may switch out Deoxys pre-trap; if so, pivot to Lugia for phazing. Revealed moves: Thunderbolt (likely coverage). Suspect set: Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost/Tbolt.\n\nMean Look attempted turn 3 to trap Deoxys. If lands, follow with Perish Song turn 4 to start countdown. Misdreavus post-Tbolt ~66 HP (before LO) ~20%. If PAR prevents move, Protect or retry next. If Deoxys switches pre-trap, switch to Lugia for safe phazing/Toxic. Revealed: Thunderbolt (Electric coverage, confirms offensive set). Suspect Deoxys moves: Taunt, Spikes, Psycho Boost.\n\nSwitched to Lugia turn 4 to preserve Misdreavus and wall Deoxys. Trap broken, but Lugia tanks hit and sets up Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind. Expect Deoxys to reveal more moves (possible Taunt/Spikes/Psycho Boost). Damage calc needed on Lugia vs Deoxys Tbolt post-hit. Stall remains: Toxic chip on threats, phaze setups, Granbull late sweep after weakening. Misdreavus at ~25% PAR for future traps.\n\nDeoxys damage output: Thunderbolt ~46% to Lugia (super effective). Suspect full special set: SpA ~150 base + EVs, likely Life Orb or Choice Specs equivalent, but item unknown. Post-Toxic, expect Deoxys to attack or switch; if switches, phaze with Whirlwind on next threat. Monitor for Spikes (common on Deoxys) or Taunt. Lugia role: Defensive wall/pivot, Toxic/Reflect/Whirlwind to control. If Deoxys stays and chips with Tbolt/Psycho Boost, Recover next if below 50%. Granbull setup after Deoxys weakened. Gengar for status/anti-setup on switches. Misdreavus low HP/PAR, save for late trap on non-Ghost sweepers like Rayquaza/Groudon.\n\nGengar switch-in takes Thunderbolt (~40-60% est.); prioritize Will-O-Wisp next to burn Deoxys (stacks with Toxic for ~12.5% + 6.25% per turn initially, halving SpA). If Deoxys reveals Psycho Boost or other moves, calc damage on Gengar/Lugia. Preserve Granbull for post-Deoxys setup/sweep. Lugia low but recoverable if Deoxys weakens; Misdreavus save for non-Ghost traps. Opponent may force Deoxys to faint here; watch for next switch (suspect Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre common Ubers threats).\n\nWill-O-Wisp impossible on Toxic'd Deoxys; focus on damage. Deoxys pattern: all Thunderbolt so far, likely continues vs switching to Psycho Boost (self-lowering risk). Thunderbolt calc: Gengar ~40-60%+ to Deoxys (est. based on frailty); aim for KO/chunk at 82%. If survives, next turn Taunt or Ice Punch if physical threat emerges. Post-Deoxys, expect switch to major threat (e.g., Rayquaza/Groudon/Kyogre); pivot Lugia for Toxic/Whirlwind phazing, preserve Granbull for Bulk Up sweep after walls down. Track Deoxys item (no LO recoil seen) and full moveset. Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR: save for specific traps/phazing.\n\nGroudon: Likely physical SD set (EQ, Fire Punch/Blast, Stone Edge); burn applied, Atk halved—monitor for Fire coverage confirmation. Post-Gengar faint, switch to Lugia for safe EQ immunity, Recover if needed, Toxic/Whirlwind to phaze/chip. Preserve Granbull full HP for Bulk Up sweep vs weakened threats. Misdreavus low/PAR: save for Mean Look trap on non-Ghost switch-ins (e.g., Rayquaza). Opponent likely has Rayquaza/Kyogre/Mewtwo; sun favors Groudon Fire but hurts Kyogre if present. Track Groudon damage output and moves next turn.\n\nGroudon confirmed moves: Earthquake (physical SD set likely with Fire/Stone Edge under sun). Burn + future Intimidate severely limits physical output. Granbull plan: Bulk Up on predicted EQ (neutral, survivable post-nerfs), then Return for STAB damage or EQ neutral chip. If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), pivot back to Gengar/Lugia for status/phazing. Sun active (turn 9, ~4 turns left est.); favors Groudon Fire moves (neutral on Granbull). Opponent remaining: Likely Rayquaza (Ice Punch coverage), Kyogre (Thunderbolt/Toxic), Mewtwo. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look on non-Ghost like Rayquaza; Lugia for Recover/Whirlwind phazing despite low HP/PAR.\n\nGroudon physical threats minimized (burn + Intim -1); Bulk Up turn 10 for +1 setup, follow with Return for ~50-70% est. damage (calc needed). If Groudon switches (probable vs setup), free boost on incoming (e.g., Rayquaza takes neutral Return, Kyogre weak). Sun ~3 turns left; watch for Fire move confirmation. Post-Groudon, pivot Lugia Recover/Toxic/Whirlwind despite PAR/low HP; sac Gengar if needed for WO on physical threats. Preserve Misdreavus Mean Look for late non-Ghost trap (Rayquaza). Win con: Setup Granbull sweeps weakened team after status/chip.\n\nSun from turn 8 (Drought): Gen 3 lasts 5 turns, upkeeps on turns 8-12; ends after turn 12. Groudon Overheat damage est: ~82% at 0 SpA under sun to full Granbull; at -2 SpA ~27%—monitor survival for calcs. Post-setup +2, Return (STAB Normal, +2 Atk) vs burned Groudon should ~50-70% or KO (calc: base 120 BP *1.5 STAB * (3.5/2.5 Atk mod) etc.). If Granbull faints, pivot Gengar WO on physical threats or Lugia Recover/Whirlwind. Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap on remaining non-Ghost (likely Rayquaza/Kyogre). Opponent likely switches post-Groudon weaken: phaze with Lugia if possible despite PAR/low HP.\n\nSun active (upkeep on turn 11; ends after turn 12). Groudon set: Physical SD likely (EQ/Overheat confirmed; expect Stone Edge/Fire Punch). Burn + Intim -1 Atk nerfs physical threats heavily; -2 SpA weakens Overheat (sun boost still ~20-30% to walls est.). Gengar Tbolt chip: ~30-40% to 76% Groudon, leaving ~40%. Next: Taunt Groudon (prevent Swords Dance/Recover if any), or WO/Ice Punch on switch-ins (Rayquaza weak to Ice). If Groudon switches (e.g., to Rayquaza/Kyogre), free momentum—Lugia Whirlwind phaze Kyogre, Misdreavus trap Rayquaza. Preserve Misdreavus low/PAR for late Mean Look/Perish Song on non-Ghost sweepers. Lugia low/PAR: Recover vs weakened/chipped threats only. Win con: Chip Groudon KO with Gengar/Lugia, status incoming threats, setup any remaining bulk if possible (none left). Opponent likely Rayquaza (dragon/flying physical) and Kyogre (water special, crippled by sun).\n\nGroudon KO via Tbolt turn 12; sun ends post-turn (Drought 5 turns from 8). Opponent last mon: Rayquaza (physical DD set likely, Ice Punch coverage) or Kyogre (CB/Specs water spam, crippled by sun end). If Rayquaza in: Taunt prevent setup, WO burn physical, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-60%). If Kyogre: Taunt/Thunderbolt chip, sac Gengar if needed then Lugia Recover/Whirlwind phaze (water resisted but low HP risk). Misdreavus Mean Look trap non-Ghost final if survives (e.g., Rayquaza). Lugia last resort wall despite 19%/PAR. Win con: KO Groudon, status/chip final threat, phaze if setup.\n\nSun ended post-turn 12; no weather now. Groudon stalls to faint soon (~2-3 turns net burn damage). Last mon: Likely Rayquaza (physical DD, Ice Punch coverage)—Taunt prevents setup, WO burns, Ice Punch SE chip (~40-50% est. from low Atk). If Kyogre (water special, sun-crippled but still threat)—Taunt prevents CM, Thunderbolt 2x damage. Mewtwo possible but less likely. Preserve Misdreavus (26% PAR) for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on non-Ghost final if survives low-HP mons; Lugia (20% PAR) for Recover/Whirlwind phazing post-Taunt. Gengar leads control: Taunt this turn, react next (WO vs physical, Tbolt vs water/psychic). If opponent sacs Groudon (e.g., Overheat/Stone Edge reveal), calc damage (~20-40% at -4 SpA) and pivot accordingly. Win con: Taunt lock final threat, status/chip with Gengar, phaze/KO with Lugia/Misdreavus if needed.\n\nGengar Ice Punch chips Groudon (est. 10-20% with low Atk); forces switch likely. If Rayquaza in: WO burn prevents DD, Ice Punch SE chip. If Kyogre: Tbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM. No weather; Lugia/Misdreavus save for phaze/trap despite low/PAR—Recover Lugia post-chip if safe. Opponent final likely Rayquaza (physical dragon, Ice weak); Mean Look trap if survives.\n\nGroudon KO'd via Ice Punch; sun long ended. Opponent's final mon likely Rayquaza (physical DD set, Ice weak—WO to burn, Ice Punch/Taunt to control setup) or Kyogre (water special—Thunderbolt 2x, Taunt anti-CM). If Rayquaza: Preserve Misdreavus for Mean Look trap/Perish Song despite low/PAR; Lugia Whirlwind phaze post-Recover if safe. If Kyogre: Gengar Tbolt chip, sac if needed then Lugia Toxic/Whirlwind (resists Water but low HP risk). Win con: Status/chip final threat with Gengar, trap/phaze with Misdreavus/Lugia to stall out.\n\nSkarmory switch-in: Likely Sturdy/Keen Eye ability, Leftovers/Rocky Helmet item, moves: Spikes, Roost, Whirlwind, Drill Peck/Brave Bird. Ice Punch 4x SE; est. damage 50-70% to full HP based on Gengar's Atk 149 vs Skarmory Def ~200+. Sun active (upkeep turn 15, duration unclear but favors potential Fire moves if any). Opponent team: Deoxys (offensive, Tbolt), Groudon (SD physical, EQ/Overheat), Skarmory (stall wall)—balanced but no water/dragon legendaries. Post-Skarmory chunk, Taunt to prevent Roost/Spikes/Whirlwind, then WO burn or Tbolt if switches to water type (unlikely). Misdreavus (26% PAR): Save for Mean Look/Perish Song trap on physical threats if Skarmory sacs. Lugia (20% PAR): Last resort Recover/Whirlwind phaze post-chip; risk vs Drill Peck. Win con: KO/chunk Skarmory with Gengar Ice Punch/Taunt, stall final with status/phaze from reserves despite low HP.\n\nSkarmory final mon: Stall set (Spikes/Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck likely); Taunt locks utility, Ice Punch chips 4x SE (~25-30%/hit from Gengar's Atk). Expect Drill Peck neutral hit (~30-50% to Gengar); survive 2-3 before pivot if needed. Reserves low/PAR/Spikes-vulnerable: Lugia for Whirlwind phaze/Recover vs Steel/Flying resist (risky at 20%), Misdreavus trap unused. Post-Taunt: Ice Punch x3-4 for KO, WO if physical confirms. No sun boost relevant. Win con: Outstall Skarmory via Taunt + chip; minimal reserve sac.\n\nSkarmory stall set confirmed (Spikes, Pursuit); burn applied turn 18, Atk halved—physical damage nerfed to ~10%/hit. Taunt ends post-turn 19; follow with Ice Punch x3-4 for KO (~20%/hit est., total ~60-80% needed from 83%). If Drill Peck revealed (>Pursuit), confirms no Fire coverage; Lugia can phaze post-KO if needed despite low/PAR (resists Flying neutral). Misdreavus unused for trap. Win con: Burn + chip to faint last mon with Gengar.\n\nSkarmory final mon at 76% burned, Taunt reapplied turn 19 (lasts turns 20-22). Expect Pursuit/Drill Peck retaliation (~20-30%/hit); Gengar survives multiple while chipping ~25-30%/Ice Punch. Post-Taunt, Ice Punch x2-3 for KO. Reserves (Misdreavus 26% PAR, Lugia 20% PAR) unused—unnecessary with Gengar's control. No further threats; focus on finishing.\n\nSkarmory stall set (Spikes, Pursuit, likely Roost/Whirlwind/Drill Peck); burned and Taunt-locked, physical output minimal (~10-15%/hit). Thunderbolt ~40-50% chunk est.; follow with 1-2 more attacks for KO next turn. Reserves (Misdreavus/Lugia low/PAR) unused—preserve for potential future but unnecessary. Opponent team depleted (Deoxys/Groudon/Skarmory fainted); focus on clean finish.\n\nCelebi final mon: bulky special (Psychic/Recover/Giga Drain/Seed?), Natural Cure. Taunt locks utility 3 turns, enabling safe Lugia pivot + Toxic. Stall: Lugia Recover/Toxic vs attacks; Toxic ramps to KO despite Recover (net loss as ticks > heal eventually). Gengar sacced, Misdreavus preserved but unnecessary. No switches possible for opp. Sun 20 turns: boosts Grass but Lugia resists.\n\nSwitched to Misdreavus vs Taunted Celebi. Expect Psychic neutral hit post-Spikes; if survives (~10-15% est.), next Mean Look trap then Perish Song (PAR risk, but locks in 3-turn faint). If KO'd, Lugia final: Recover if safe, Toxic to ramp damage (Taunt blocks Celebi Recover), Whirlwind phaze if setup suspected. Celebi likely Psychic STAB, Giga Drain (sun-boosted neutral), Recover (blocked), utility like Baton Pass/Heal Bell (blocked). Natural Cure irrelevant without status. Win con: Trap Perish Song or Toxic stall-out; Lugia high SpD/Leftovers edges long fight.\n\nCelebi final mon, likely bulky special set (Psychic/Giga Drain/Recover/utility), Taunted (active turns 22-23/24). Perish Song forces Celebi faint end turn 25; Lugia (~20% post-Spikes) tanks resisted Psychics (est. 10-20% damage/hit), Recover turn 23-24 if below 50% for safety, Leftovers sustains. No further threats; win secured via trap countdown + stall.\n\nTurn 22: Mean Look to trap Celebi; expect Psychic ~10-15% damage, survive to Perish Song turn 23 (Taunt ends post-22, enabling status moves on 23). If faint, Lugia switch: Toxic for ramping chip (Psychic/Giga Drain resisted, sun-boosts Grass neutral ~20-30%), Recover sustain, Whirlwind phaze setups. Celebi bulky special likely (Psychic STAB, Giga Drain sun-boost, Recover blocked until 23); Natural Cure irrelevant. Win con: Perish trap countdown or Toxic + Leftovers edge; Lugia walls long-term.\n\nMisdreavus fainted turn 22 to Hidden Power (super effective on Ghost, likely HP Fire/Ice/Rock). Celebi final: Bulky special (Psychic STAB resisted, Giga Drain likely resisted/sun-boost ~15-25% est., Recover for sustain, possible HP coverage/utility). Natural Cure irrelevant without status yet. Lugia walls: High SpD/Def, Leftovers, Pressure (PP drain key vs repeated Recover/attacks). Toxic turn 23 starts poison (ticks 24+); expect Celebi Recover/attack first (resisted ~10-20%).

Celebi, the final opponent Pokémon, is Toxic poisoned at 94% HP and will suffer escalating poison damage (next tick ~12.5%, reaching ~81.5%). Lugia's role is to stall as a defensive wall using recovery and status. Recover restores 208 HP, boosting to ~261/416 (~63%), enabling it to tank resisted moves like Psychic (0.5x) or Giga Drain (0.5x under sun). Hidden Power (likely Dark/Ghost, 2x) is riskier but survivable post-Recover. Paralysis poses a 25% failure risk, but attempting Recover addresses the immediate threat. Toxic is already applied (redundant). Whirlwind fails to phaze the last mon. Reflect improves defenses but doesn't solve low HP. Pressure will drain Celebi's PP (e.g., 4 max Recovers), aiding long-term stall. Leftovers sustains both, but Toxic ramps faster than Celebi's potential heals. Plan: Recover now, then repeat vs attacks/drains; win via poison chip outpacing recovery.", "action": "recover", "scratchpad": "Celebi final mon: Bulky special set confirmed Psychic (resisted), Hidden Power [likely Dark/Ghost, 2x on Lugia], expect Giga Drain (resisted/sun-boost ~15-25%, self-heal). Natural Cure resets Toxic on switch (irrelevant). Pressure drains 2 PP/use—limits Recover to ~4x, attacks similarly. Toxic ticks: Turn 24 end 81.5%, 25: ~62.75%, 26: ~43.5%, 27: ~24.25%, 28: KO if no heal. Lugia post-Recover ~63% +6.25% LO/turn; tanks 3-4 resisted hits. If HP 2x ~30-40% damage est., Recover sustains. If Giga Drain, minimal net gain for Celebi due resist + Toxic. No sun end soon (upkeep ongoing).
