My Tyranitar is at -1 ATK. Salamence is likely to carry Earthquake, making Omastar and Mewtwo risky switches. Celebi is a safe switch, but Salamence has high special defense. Consider Dragon Dance on Tyranitar to negate the Intimidate drop and set up. Opponent might switch out of Salamence anticipating a Tyranitar attack, giving a free boost.\n\nMy Tyranitar is at +1 Attack and +1 Speed. Salamence is still at full HP. Rock Slide is super effective. I need to keep pressuring with super effective moves. Next turn, I should consider if Salamence is still active or if a new threat arrives.\n\nMy Tyranitar is at +1 ATK, +1 SPE, but critically low HP. Salamence has Intimidate and Leftovers. Opponent's Salamence missed Rock Slide last turn, giving me a free hit with Dragon Claw. Now it has 67/342 HP. I switched to Celebi to absorb a hit and scout the opponent's next move. I need to observe if Salamence switches out or attacks with a different move now that Celebi is in. My team will need a way to deal with Salamence quickly given its current HP. Celebi can use Leech Seed or Psychic to chip away at Salamence if it stays in, or recover with Recover.\n\nMy Tyranitar is almost fainted. Salamence is at full health, has Intimidate and Leftovers. Celebi can chip away at Salamence with Leech Seed and Psychic while healing with Leftovers and Recover. Omastar and Mewtwo are my other strong special attackers with good coverage. Omastar has Swift Swim, which can be useful if I set up Rain Dance, but for now, Salamence has no water weakness. Mewtwo is a powerful special attacker and can potentially OHKO Salamence with Ice Beam, but has low physical defense and would get hit hard by Dragon Claw. The immediate goal is to wear down Salamence, then determine the best switch-in for future threats.\n\nMy Tyranitar is almost fainted. Salamence is at full health, has Intimidate and Leftovers.

The opponent's Salamence also has Leftovers, meaning it regains some health. We need to identify any other moves from Salamence and determine if there's a better switch-in. Omastar and Mewtwo are powerful special attackers available, but both have their vulnerabilities. Mewtwo could potentially OHKO Salamence with Ice Beam, but physical attacks would be devastating.

Opponent switched in Celebi. My Celebi is at 94.55% HP. Opponent's Celebi is at 94.55% HP. Sandstorm is active. I have Leech Seed on their Celebi. Given both are Celebi, pressing offensive pressure with Psychic is the best option to chip down the opponent faster.\nTurn 22: My Celebi used Thunderbolt on opponent's Celebi and paralyzed them, while opponent's Celebi hit me with Psychic. Both took Sandstorm damage. My Celebi is at 74% and opponent's Celebi is at 80%.\nTurn 23: My Celebi used Thunderbolt on opponent's Celebi. Opponent's Celebi used Recover to heal. Both took Sandstorm damage. My Celebi is at 74% and opponent's Celebi is at 100% (paralyzed). The opponent's Celebi is now fully healed but still paralyzed. I am at full HP and should take advantage of their paralysis to chip them down further by attacking. If I used Leech Seed, they would just Recover it off, and since I am at full HP, Recover is not beneficial. My Thunderbolt is super effective against water types, and the opponent has a Lanturn."}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

Switching to my Groudon makes sense to resist potential Earthquakes and allows me a setup opportunity. Need to observe opponent Groudon's moveset. My Groudon's HP is at 67%. Swords Dance offers a setup opportunity. Opponent Groudon's item and full moveset still unknown. Watch out for Overheat.\n\nOpponent's Groudon seems to be physical. My Groudon is at +2 Atk but very low HP. Switched to Lugia to scout and wall. Will need to find an opportunity for Groudon to come back in later with its boosted attack or for one of my other pokemon. Keep an eye on opponent Groudon's item and full moveset.\n\nOpponent's Omastar fainted. Groudon is out with Drought. My Magneton in a bad spot; switched to my Groudon. Opponent's Groudon used Earthquake. My Groudon used Swords Dance at low HP. Switched to Lugia to wall Groudon. Lugia is immune to Earthquake, so I can set up Reflect to support my team against Groudon's physical attacks. Still need to determine Groudon's full moveset and item.\n\nOpponent's Omastar fainted.

Lugia is immune to Earthquake, so I can set up Reflect to support my team against Groudon's physical attacks. Opponent Groudon used Hidden Power (Super Effective on Lugia), indicating it's likely Grass or Ice. Reflect is up. Now, using Whirlwind to phaze Groudon and gain information about the next opponent is the optimal play, as it also removes any potential boosts. Still need to determine Groudon's full moveset and item after checking its next move.\n\nOpponent's Omastar fainted. Groudon is out with Drought. My Magneton in a bad spot; switched to my Groudon. Opponent's Groudon used Earthquake. My Groudon used Swords Dance at low HP. Switched to Lugia to wall Groudon. Lugia is immune to Earthquake, so I used Reflect. Opponent Groudon used Hidden Power, confirming it was either Grass or Ice type. Lugia then used Whirlwind, phazing Groudon into Misdreavus. My current active Lugia is at low HP (58%). Misdreavus is a Ghost type, immune to Whirlwind. Misdreavus is likely a special attacker or setup Pokémon. Toxic is a good option to apply passive pressure and chip damage, as I might need to switch Lugia later to preserve it. Will observe Misdreavus's moveset to understand its role.\n\nOpponent's Omastar fainted. Groudon is out with Drought. My Magneton in a bad spot; switched to my Groudon.

Opponent Groudon used Hidden Power, confirming it was either Grass or Ice type. Lugia then used Whirlwind, phazing Groudon into Misdreavus. I used Toxic on Misdreavus, and it used Mean Look, trapping my Lugia. My Lugia is at 65% due to a critical hit. Misdreavus is poisoned. Using Recover to heal Lugia and continue applying Toxic pressure. Need to identify Misdreavus's full moveset and prevent any setup or Destiny Bond plays.\n\nOpponent's Omastar fainted.

I used Toxic on Misdreavus, and it used Mean Look, trapping my Lugia. My Lugia used Recover to heal to full. Misdreavus is poisoned. Since Misdreavus is trapped, I will use Whirlwind again to force a switch and continue gathering information on the opponent's team, while Misdreavus continues to take Toxic damage.\n\nOpponent's Omastar fainted.

Opponent's Groudon has taken some damage, but its exact HP is unknown due to it being switched in. My Groudon is at 19% HP.

Swords Dance offers a setup opportunity. Opponent Groudon's item and full moveset still unknown. Watch out for Overheat.\n\nOpponent's Groudon seems to be physical. My Groudon is at +2 Atk but very low HP. Switched to Lugia to scout and wall. Will need to find an opportunity for Groudon to come back in later with its boosted attack or for one of my other pokemon. Keep an eye on opponent Groudon's item and full moveset.\n\nOpponent's Omastar fainted. Groudon is out with Drought. My Magneton in a bad spot; switched to my Groudon. Opponent's Groudon used Earthquake. My Groudon used Swords Dance at low HP. Switched to Lugia to wall Groudon.

Opponent Groudon used Hidden Power (Super Effective on Lugia), indicating it's likely Grass or Ice. Reflect is up. Now, using Whirlwind to phaze Groudon and gain information about the next opponent is the optimal play, as it also removes any potential boosts.

Opponent Groudon used Hidden Power, confirming it was either Grass or Ice type. Lugia then used Whirlwind, phazing Groudon into Misdreavus. My current active Lugia is at low HP (58%). Misdreavus is a Ghost type, immune to Whirlwind. Misdreavus is likely a special attacker or setup Pokémon. Toxic is a good option to apply passive pressure and chip damage, as I might need to switch Lugia later to preserve it.
