turn):\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting). Likely offensive set. Watch out for Megahorn and Close Combat. My Raikou is faster. Consider setting up with Calm Mind after Substitute is up. Will need to identify Heracross's item (e.g., Choice Band) and full moveset. Next turn, if Heracross breaks substitute, decide if Thunderbolt is enough, or if a switch to Aerodactyl (Flying STAB) or Granbull (potentially physical wall) is better. If Heracross switches, I might have a free Calm Mind.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting). Likely offensive set. Confirmed Megahorn. My Raikou is faster. I successfully set up a Substitute. Heracross broke the substitute with Megahorn. Now I have a free turn to set up. I expect Heracross to attack again this turn. Plan is to set up a Calm Mind while the Substitute is active, then hit with Thunderbolt. Will need to identify Heracross's item (e.g., Choice Band) and full moveset in upcoming turns.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting). Likely offensive set. Confirmed Megahorn and Swords Dance. Heracross is now at +2 attack. My Raikou is faster and has +1 Special Attack and +1 Special Defense. Thunderbolt is super effective. If Thunderbolt doesn't one-shot Heracross, Raikou might be in trouble, but it's the best offensive play to eliminate the threat quickly. If Heracross survives, I may need to consider switching to Granbull (intimidate) or Aerodactyl next turn if Raikou is in KO range.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) is confirmed to have Megahorn and Swords Dance. It is now critically low on health. Raikou is boosted in Special Attack and Special Defense, and an unresisted Thunderbolt will finish it off. Remaining opponent Pokémon are unknown. Once Heracross is down, I will need to consider the next opponent and plan accordingly. Raikou has good special bulk after a Calm Mind and good speed, positioning it well to continue sweeping or pivot if needed.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) has been severely weakened and likely carries Megahorn and Swords Dance. Mankey fainted. Gardevoir (Psychic) is now active, with Trace copying Pressure. Raikou has +1 SpA/+1 SpD and full health. Thunderbolt is resisted by Gardevoir. I need to determine Gardevoir's moveset and item. Another Calm Mind will further boost Raikou and allow me to scout Gardevoir's next move without much risk. Potential threats from Gardevoir could be Psychic STAB, boosting moves, or status. With another Calm Mind, Raikou becomes a very significant threat to the opponent's remaining team.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) has been defeated. Mankey fainted. Gardevoir (Psychic) was observed briefly, copying Pressure. Now Shelgon (Dragon) is out. Raikou is at full health with +2 SpA and +2 SpD. Shelgon is likely slow and focused on physical defense (Rock Head ability). Thunderblot and Hidden Power (Dark) are neutral. Another Calm Mind will further boost Raikou, making it a powerful special attacker and tank. This sets Raikou up for a potential sweep. I should try to determine Shelgon's full moveset and item soon. After another Calm Mind, I will assess if Thunderbolt is sufficient to one-shot Shelgon or if I need to consider switching or if Hidden Power would be better if its typing matches a weakness (e.g. Ice or Grass Hidden Power). With +3 boosts, Raikou should be able to threaten most unresisted opponents. I will keep an eye out for potential physically offensive threats that could punish Raikou's lower physical defense.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) copied Pressure. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability. My Raikou is currently at full health with +2 SpA and +2 SpD. Elekid was Roared in and is level 5, making it essentially useless. Raikou should come back in to continue its sweep or apply pressure. I need to observe Shelgon's moveset to determine if it has any moves to counter Raikou (e.g., Earthquake or Dragon Claw/Dragon Pulse). If Shelgon attempts another Roar, I can pivot to a different Pokemon or use a boosting move if Raikou comes back in. Thunderbolt is neutral, and a potential Hidden Power (Ice for Dragon-types) is unknown. I will continue to try and sweep with Raikou.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) copied Pressure. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability. My Raikou is currently at 82.61% HP, no stat boosts after being Roared out. Shelgon previously used Body Slam and Roar. Raikou is faster and should continue to set up with Calm Mind. I need to observe Shelgon's full moveset to determine if it has any moves to counter Raikou (e.g., Earthquake or Dragon Claw/Dragon Pulse). If Shelgon attempts another Roar, I can pivot to a different Pokemon or use a boosting move if Raikou comes back in. Thunderbolt is neutral, and a potential Hidden Power (Ice for Dragon-types) is unknown. I will continue to try and sweep with Raikou. Once Raikou has sufficient boosts, I can use Thunderbolt to attack Shelgon. I should keep an eye on Raikou's HP and consider switching if it drops too low or if Shelgon reveals a super-effective move.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) copied Pressure. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability. My Raikou is currently at 82.61% HP, no stat boosts after being Roared out. Shelgon previously used Body Slam and Roar. Raikou should be switched back in immediately to continue its setup. I need to get Raikou back into play and continue setting up Calm Minds. Shelgon is likely a defensive Pokémon that relies on Roar to prevent setup. My goal is to maximize Raikou's Special Attack and Special Defense to sweep through the opponent's team. Once Raikou has sufficient boosts, I can use Thunderbolt to attack Shelgon. I should also be mindful of potential status conditions from Body Slam's paralysis chance. I will pay close attention to any other moves Shelgon reveals.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) copied Pressure. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability. My Raikou is currently at 64.60% HP, no stat boosts after being Roared out twice. Shelgon previously used Body Slam and Roar. Raikou should continue to set up with Calm Mind. I need to observe Shelgon's full moveset to determine if it has any moves to counter Raikou (e.g., Earthquake or Dragon Claw/Dragon Pulse). If Shelgon attempts another Roar, I can pivot to a different Pokemon or use a boosting move if Raikou comes back in. Thunderbolt is neutral, and a potential Hidden Power (Ice for Dragon-types) is unknown. I will continue to try and sweep with Raikou. Once Raikou has sufficient boosts, I can use Thunderbolt to attack Shelgon. I should keep an eye on Raikou's HP and consider switching if it drops too low or if Shelgon reveals a super-effective move. I will need to be careful of Body Slam's paralysis chance. If Raikou gets to +3 or +4 special attack, it should be able to threaten many of the opponent's Pokémon. Gardevoir remains a potential threat with Psychic STAB, but Raikou's rising SpD should help. The level 5 Elekid was likely just sac bait for Roar. Aerodactyl or Granbull might be needed if Raikou goes down, but Raikou is my primary win condition here.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) is now active, copying Pressure. Shelgon (Dragon) was previously active with Rock Head ability and used Body Slam and Roar. My Raikou is currently at 70.81% HP with +1 SpA and +1 SpD. I need to continue setting up with Calm Mind to sweep. Gardevoir's moveset and item are unknown, but it's likely a special attacker. Another Calm Mind will bring Raikou to +2 SpA and +2 SpD, making it significantly more threatening and tanky. I need to keep an eye on Raikou's HP and determine Gardevoir's full moveset. If Gardevoir has a super-effective move or incapacitating status, I might need to consider switching or attacking. For now, boosting is the priority. The level 5 Elekid was likely just sac bait for Roar. Aerodactyl or Granbull might be needed if Raikou goes down, but Raikou is my primary win condition here.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Shelgon (Dragon) was previously active with Rock Head ability and used Body Slam and Roar. Gardevoir (Psychic) is now active, copying Pressure. Gardevoir used Calm Mind in the previous turn and is at full health. Raikou is at 77% HP with +2 SpA and +2 SpD. Raikou is faster than Gardevoir. I will use Thunderbolt to try and take out Gardevoir. I still need to confirm Gardevoir's full moveset and item. After Gardevoir is dealt with, I will reassess the remaining threats, particularly Shelgon if it returns. Raikou is still my primary win condition. Keep track of PP usage on Thunderbolt and Calm Mind. If Shelgon comes back, Raikou should be able to handle it after a few more boosts, but its physical defense is still a potential weakness against Shelgon's Body Slam.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Shelgon (Dragon) was previously active with Rock Head ability and used Body Slam and Roar. Gardevoir (Psychic) is now active, copying Pressure. Gardevoir used Calm Mind on turns 11 and 12, taking it to +2 SpA/+2 SpD. Raikou is at 83% HP with +2 SpA and +2 SpD. Raikou is faster than Gardevoir. Thunderbolt is a neutral hit and should be able to finish off the weakened Gardevoir (currently at 42% HP). After Gardevoir is dealt with, I will reassess the remaining threats, particularly Shelgon if it returns. Raikou is still my primary win condition, and taking out Gardevoir quickly is essential to maintaining momentum. Keep track of PP usage on Thunderbolt and Calm Mind. Shelgon's moveset still isn't fully revealed beyond Body Slam and Roar; need to watch for potential physical attacks that could threaten Raikou (e.g., Rock Slide or Earthquake if it's there). Hidden Power's type is Dark, which is not optimal against Shelgon or Gardevoir. Substitute could be useful later if Raikou has more boosts and is healthy enough.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) defeated. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability. My Raikou is currently at 89.44% HP with +2 SpA and +2 SpD. Shelgon previously used Body Slam and Roar. Thunderbolt is neutral. I will use Thunderbolt on Shelgon. I still need to confirm Shelgon's full moveset and item. If Shelgon survives the Thunderbolt, I need to reassess. Raikou is still my primary win condition. Keep track of PP usage on Thunderbolt and Calm Mind. My Hidden Power is Dark, which is not optimal against Shelgon. Substitute could be useful later if Raikou has more boosts and is healthy enough. Raikou's physical defense is still a potential weakness against Shelgon's Body Slam, so I need to be careful with its HP. Granbull has Intimidate and Heal Bell, which could be useful if Raikou gets crippled by status or needs a pivot. Aerodactyl has Choice Band but might not outspeed everything remaining, and it has an unfortunate typing against probable Dragon-type moves from Shelgon if it has them.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) defeated. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability, and at 25% HP due to Raikou's Thunderbolt, but its attack is lowered by Intimidate. It has used Body Slam and Roar. My Raikou is currently at 89.44% HP with +2 SpA and +2 SpD. Switching Raikou back in to continue the sweep. Thunderbolt is neutral, but with +2 SpA, it might be enough to finish off Shelgon. If Shelgon Roars again, I can continue to pivot. Granbull provided a key Intimidate. Need to keep an eye on Raikou's HP and determine Shelgon's full moveset. Aerodactyl might be a good cleanup Pokémon, but Raikou is the main threat.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) defeated. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability and currently at 31% HP. It has used Body Slam and Roar. My Raikou is still at 89.44% HP with +2 SpA and +2 SpD, but was temporarily Roared out. Granbull was Roared in and applied Intimidate, lowering Shelgon's attack. I need to switch Raikou back in to continue the sweep. Raikou's Thunderbolt is neutral and with +2 SpA should be able to finish off or heavily damage Shelgon. I need to be aware of Body Slam's paralysis chance. If Raikou gets paralyzed, it could jeopardize the sweep. Once Shelgon is defeated, I need to evaluate the final remaining opponent. My Hidden Power is Dark, which is not optimal against Shelgon. Substitute could be useful later if Raikou has more boosts and is healthy enough. Granbull has Heal Bell which could remove status if needed, and Aerodactyl is a strong offensive backup.\n\nOpponent: Heracross (Bug/Fighting) defeated. Mankey defeated. Gardevoir (Psychic) defeated. Shelgon (Dragon) is now active, with Rock Head ability and currently at 37% HP. It has used Body Slam and Roar. Its attack is lowered by two stages due to Intimidate. My Elekid is active, but is level 5 and has no utility here. My Raikou is at 89.44% HP with +2 SpA and +2 SpD and needs to switch back in to continue trying to sweep. Thunderbolt is neutral against Shelgon, but with Raikou's boosts, it should be enough to finish off Shelgon. I need to be aware of Body Slam's paralysis chance if Shelgon gets a hit on Raikou. Once Shelgon is defeated, I need to evaluate the final remaining opponent. My Hidden Power is Dark, which is not optimal against Shelgon.

Elekid, being level 5, is useless in this situation and acts as sacrificial fodder. Shelgon is at 43% HP with its attack lowered by two stages due to Granbull's Intimidate. While Raikou has +2 Special Attack and +2 Special Defense from previous Calm Minds, those boosts are reset when a Pokémon is Roared out and then switches back in manually. Therefore Raikou currently has no boosts. I need to get Raikou back into play to continue the sweep. Shelgon's Body Slam is its only offensive move we've seen, and its attack is significantly lowered. Raikou should be able to take hits, especially with its natural speed to potentially outspeed and attack.

\"gengar\",\n    \"lanturn\"\n  ]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate. Lanturn's special attacks could still do damage, but Gengar offers better type matchup and speed control. Need to determine Hitmontop's full moveset and item. Consider if Hitmontop carries coverage moves that could hit Gengar. Swampert is also an option for physical bulk if Hitmontop is a physical attacker, but Gengar's immunity is superior here.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate and used Bulk Up. Gengar is immune to Fighting. Initial thoughts of Hitmontop's possible moveset include Fighting STAB (e.g., Sky Uppercut, High Jump Kick), Mach Punch for priority, Earthquake for coverage, and possibly a status move or Rapid Spin. By burning it with Will-O-Wisp, I neutralize its physical attacking power effectively. If it has a special attack, it won't be boosted by Bulk Up. It's likely a physical attacker based on Bulk Up. I need to observe if it has any way to negate status or if it switches out, and what it switches into. Keep track of Gengar's PP on Will-O-Wisp as it's crucial for burning physical threats. Next turn, depending on whether it switches or attacks, I can consider Taunt to stop further setup/recovery/status, or Thunderbolt/Ice Punch for damage.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate and used Bulk Up twice, now burned. Its attack is halved, making it much less threatening. Gengar is immune to Fighting moves. I've noted Hitmontop's likely physical attacking nature. The immediate goal is to continue dealing damage to Hitmontop to force it out or knock it out. Its current HP is 88%. By using Thunderbolt, I apply more pressure. If it switches, I can predict and act accordingly next turn. Current moves revealed for Hitmontop: Bulk Up. Its item is still unknown, but Choice Scarf is unlikely given it used Bulk Up twice.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate, used Bulk Up twice, is burned, and its current HP is 49%. It used Hidden Power against Gengar. Gengar is immune to Fighting-type moves. The goal is to keep pressure on Hitmontop, forcing it out or KOing it. Gengar should continue attacking with Thunderbolt. I need to keep an eye on Hitmontop's health and potential switches. If it switches to a more specially defensive Pokémon, I'll reassess. Hitmontop's item is Leftovers. Thunderbolt was supereffective according to the battle log. I also need to confirm what type this Hidden Power was. Based on the super effective hit on Gengar (Poison/Ghost), it's likely a Ground-type Hidden Power. This means Swampert would be immune to it, and Metagross would take neutral damage. Lanturn would take neutral damage as well after Intimidate. For now, attacking is the best option to maintain offensive momentum.\n\nMy Gengar has successfully burned Hitmontop, severely reducing its physical attack output. Hitmontop, now at 49% HP and holding Leftovers, revealed Hidden Power (likely Ground-type). The opponent switched into Aipom, which is now at 44% HP. My Gengar continues to chip away at the opponent's team with Thunderbolt. Knocking out Aipom will force the opponent to send out another Pokémon, potentially Hitmontop again, which is still burned and weakened. I need to keep track of the opponent's full team composition once more Pokémon are revealed, and consider if Gengar has a good matchup against their remaining Pokémon or if a switch would be more beneficial. Lanturn, Swampert, and Metagross are all available if Gengar's effectiveness wanes.\n\nMy Gengar is doing well against the opponent's revealed Pokémon so far. Hitmontop is burned and weakened, Aipom was chipped, and now Drowzee is being pressured. I need to keep track of Drowzee's moves and item (revealed Leftovers) to formulate a long-term plan. If Drowzee turns out to be a special attacker, Gengar's good Special Defense might help, but its low HP stat means it can't take many hits. The goal is to continue dealing damage to Drowzee to either knock it out or force another switch. I anticipate they may switch back to Hitmontop if Drowzee proves ineffective or takes too much damage. If so, Hitmontop is still burned and at relatively low HP, so Gengar with Thunderbolt would likely still be effective.\n\nMy Gengar is doing well against the opponent's revealed Pokémon so far.

I anticipate they may switch back to Hitmontop if Drowzee proves ineffective or takes too much damage. If so, Hitmontop is still burned and at relatively low HP, so Gengar with Thunderbolt would likely still be effective. Drowzee has used Wish, so it will heal itself in the next turn if I don't knock it out this turn. Gengar is faster so I should be able to get another hit in.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate, used Bulk Up twice, is burned, and its current HP is 49%. It used Hidden Power (likely Ground-type). Opponent's Aipom is at 44% HP. Opponent's Drowzee has Wish and Protect, and is holding Leftovers. Drowzee is now back to full health. Gengar is at full HP. The next turn, I will likely use Thunderbolt to severely damage Drowzee, as it should no longer be able to Protect itself or use Wish immediately. After Taunt, I will continue to pressure Drowzee, considering Thunderbolt for super-effective damage. I need to keep track of Taunt's PP and Drowzee's HP. I should also consider how to handle Aipom if it switches back in, and Hitmontop if it comes back out and its burn damage puts it in range of another attack or a switch. The overall strategy is to wear down Drowzee before moving on to Aipom or the burned Hitmontop. I have identified a defensive/stalling strategy from the opponent with Drowzee; Taunt is the best counter to this.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate, used Bulk Up twice, is burned, and its current HP is 49% (likely holding Leftovers, Hidden Power is likely Ground). Opponent's Aipom is at 44% HP. Opponent's Drowzee has Wish and Protect, is holding Leftovers, and is now at full health. Drowzee used Protect in turns 7 and 8, so a third consecutive Protect will fail. Gengar is at full HP. Taunting Drowzee this turn will prevent it from using Wish/Protect and allow Gengar to deal damage. I need to keep track of Taunt's duration. After Taunt lands, I will switch to using Thunderbolt to deal super-effective damage to Drowzee. Once Drowzee is dealt with, I will assess whether to continue with Gengar against Aipom (which Gengar outspeeds and can hit with Thunderbolt) or if Hitmontop switches in. The long-term goal is to chip away at the opponent's team members while preserving my own resources.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate, used Bulk Up twice, is burned, and its current HP is 49% (likely holding Leftovers, Hidden Power is likely Ground). Opponent's Aipom is at 44% HP. Opponent's Drowzee has Wish, Protect, and Psychic, is holding Leftovers, and is currently Taunted, preventing status/healing/Protect moves. Drowzee's Psychic is super-effective against Gengar. Gengar's SpD is -1. Gengar is at 67.49% HP and cannot take another super-effective Psychic hit. I need to get Gengar out of danger. Metagross resists Psychic, making it a safe switch-in to absorb Drowzee's attack. Once Metagross is in, I can assess whether to attack Drowzee with a super-effective Meteor Mash or Earthquake, or to set up. I need to keep track of the duration of Taunt on Drowzee. Metagross also has Pursuit for Aipom if the opponent tries to switch, and Earthquake for Hitmontop. Metagross currently has full HP.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is burned, at 49% HP, holding Leftovers, and likely has Ground-type Hidden Power. Opponent's Aipom is at 44% HP. Opponent's Drowzee has revealed Wish, Protect, and Psychic, and holds Leftovers. Drowzee's Taunt is now over. Metagross is at full HP and is a good offensive presence against Drowzee. Metagross should aim to knock out Drowzee or force a switch. Earthquake could be useful if Drowzee switches to a Ghost or other Pokémon weak to Ground, but Meteor Mash is better for hitting Drowzee super-effectively. I'll need to re-evaluate the opponent's next move after Drowzee is pressured. Metagross also has Explosion as a last resort, and Pursuit for potential switches.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is burned, at 49% HP, holding Leftovers, and likely has Ground-type Hidden Power. Opponent's Aipom is at 44% HP. Drowzee is about to be knocked out. Once Drowzee is down, I will need to reassess the opponent's next switch-in. If Aipom comes in, Metagross can hit it with Meteor Mash or Earthquake. If Hitmontop comes in, Metagross can still hit it with Meteor Mash or Earthquake, but I'll need to consider its burned status and remaining bulk. I have Pursuit on Metagross if they attempt to switch out in anticipation of an attack. My Gengar is at 67% HP, Lanturn and Swampert are at full HP. I have good offensive pressure overall.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is burned, at 49% HP, holding Leftovers, and likely has Ground-type Hidden Power. Opponent's Aipom is at 44% HP. Drowzee has fainted. The opponent has sent out a level 5 Ponyta. Metagross should use Earthquake to easily defeat Ponyta. After Ponyta is removed, I will need to consider whether Hitmontop or Aipom is sent out next. Metagross has good matchups against both, with Meteor Mash for Aipom and Earthquake for Hitmontop. My team is in a strong position with Metagross still at full health and Gengar, Lanturn, and Swampert available at good health."}], "response": {"reasoning": "API error: Server error '502 Bad Gateway' for url 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions'\nFor more information check: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/502", "action": null}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent's Clefable is likely a bulky special attacker or a wall. Key moves to watch for include Calm Mind, Softboiled/Wish, and an attacking move like Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, or Psychic. Since it's the first turn, observing its chosen move will be critical to understanding its set and role. If Clefable opts to attack, I'll need to assess damage and consider switching to a more appropriate counter, such as Cradily or Registeel, both of whom have good special bulk. If Clefable sets up, I may need to switch to Porygon2 to try and Trace its ability if it's something useful or break its setup with my own offense. Focusing on passive damage for now seems like a safe play.\n\nOpponent's Clefable is now poisoned. Its Meteor Mash might indicate a physical set, but it's more likely a mixed attacker or a physically defensive set with a primary physical attack. I will continue to observe its moves to confirm its set. Quilava's Fire Blast hits hard, and with Clefable poisoned, I should be able to wear it down. If Clefable switches, I will need to reassess based on the new opponent. I should be wary of Clefable's potential for recovery (Softboiled, Wish) or boosting moves (Calm Mind). My team has good defensive pivots in Porygon2 and Registeel for special attackers, and Cradily for physical attackers. I will keep an eye on Quilava's HP, as it took some damage from Meteor Mash.\n\nClefable is poisoned and under pressure. It's likely going to be knocked out next turn or be forced to switch. If it switches, I need to reassess based on the new opponent. If it stays in and recovers, I'll need to keep up the damage. Quilava's Fire Blast continues to be effective. I am now fairly certain Clefable is playing a more offensive or physically defensive role given Meteor Mash, but the lack of other moves makes it hard to pinpoint its exact set. I'll maintain offensive pressure to wear it down.\n\nOpponent's Clefable has fainted. Aipom is now active. Aipom is a fast, normal-type Pokémon. It is likely a physical attacker given its base stats, but its moves are currently unknown. I need to scout Aipom's moveset and item to determine the best counter. Quilava's Fire Blast will apply immediate pressure. I should consider switching to Porygon2 or Registeel if Aipom proves to be a strong physical attacker that threatens Quilava, or if it sets up with a boosting move. Cradily could also be an option against physical attackers, though Aipom's speed could be an issue. I will continue to track Quilava's HP and conserve its PP. Key information to gather this turn: Aipom's item, ability, and at least one move.\n\nMy Quilava has fainted. The opponent's Clefable is also fainted. The opponent has switched in Aipom, which has been revealed to have Double-Edge. This confirms Aipom is a physical attacker. I need to switch in a Pokemon that can tank Aipom's attacks and retaliate effectively. Cradily seems like the best choice here due to its resistance to Normal-type attacks (from being Rock/Grass) and having Rock Slide which is super effective. I need to be mindful of Aipom's potential Guts ability if it gets statused, though its ability is currently 'None'. Also, keep an eye on Aipom's item, which is currently unknown. My remaining team consists of Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage), Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing), and Registeel (special wall, stall potential). I will gather more information on Aipom's full moveset and ability as the battle progresses to refine my strategy.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 is likely a bulky special attacker or a wall. I need to scout its moves. Earthquake is a strong physical attack that Aipom will take neutral damage from. If Porygon2 is a special attacker, Cradily's high special defense will help. If Porygon2 is a physical attacker, Cradily's physical defense is decent. My remaining team consists of Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage), Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing), and Registeel (special wall, stall potential). I will continue to gather information on Porygon2's full moveset and item to refine my strategy. I should be wary of Porygon2's potential for status moves like Thunder Wave or Toxic, or recovery moves like Recover. I also need to confirm if it's a special or physical attacker, as its move 'Trace' only reveals the ability, not the move set or item. Cradily should be able to hold its own for a turn or two. If Porygon2 proves too powerful, I have Registeel, a good special wall, and my own Porygon2 as backup.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 has revealed Ice Beam, confirming it's a special attacker. Registeel is an optimal switch-in given its Steel typing and high special defense. My Porygon2 is also a good match-up against the opponent's Porygon2 given its move set of Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Recover. I will need to continue scouting Porygon2's moves, specifically if it has other coverage or status moves like Thunder Wave or Toxic. My Registeel has Rest and Sleep Talk, making it a good stall option, and Toxic to put pressure on. I will consider using Toxic on Registeel to chip away at Porygon2 and force it to use Recover more frequently, or to pressure a switch out. The current strategy is to pivot to Registeel to absorb damage and then assess the best long-term play.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 has revealed Ice Beam, confirming it's a special attacker. Registeel was switched in and then frozen by Ice Beam. My Registeel has Rest and Sleep Talk, making it a good stall option, and Toxic to put pressure on. Although Registeel is frozen, switching out to Porygon2 is the most proactive play. My Porygon2 has good special defense and offensive coverage with Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Recover for sustainability. I need to observe if the opponent's Porygon2 has other coverage moves or status moves like Thunder Wave or Toxic. My Porygon2 can apply offensive pressure and force switches or use Recover to stall out the opponent. I will aim to thaw Registeel later in the match by switching it back in when it's safe. I have two remaining Pokémon: Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing with Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, Recover) and Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage with Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, Recover). My Porygon2 should be able to handle the opponent's Porygon2 given its type neutrality and potential for super effective hits with Thunderbolt if the opponent's Porygon2 is not Electric type. Since the opponent's Porygon2 is Normal type, my Porygon2's Thunderbolt will be neutral, and Ice Beam will be neutral. The goal is to wear down their Porygon2 or force a switch. I will also monitor the opponent's remaining team composition as they are down to one revealed Pokémon.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 has revealed Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, confirming it's a special attacker. My Porygon2 is also active. The opponent's Porygon2 appears to be faster than mine. My Porygon2 took a Thunderbolt and is at 86%. I hit their Porygon2 for approximately 20% with my Thunderbolt last turn, which means it will take 2-3 more Thunderbolts to knock it out. My Porygon2 has Recover to mitigate damage. Registeel is frozen but has Rest and Sleep Talk, making it a potential late-game stall option. Cradily is available as well, but my Porygon2 is currently in the best position to handle the opponent's Porygon2. The current strategy is to try and out-damage the opponent's Porygon2. I will monitor Porygon2's HP and PP. I have two remaining Pokémon: Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing with Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, Recover) and Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage with Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, Recover). I predict the opponent will continue to hit with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam. My Porygon2 is Normal type, so both are neutral. Recover could be used to heal off damage as needed. Since I know the opponent's Porygon2 has Leftovers, I need to apply consistent pressure to offset its recovery.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet. The opponent's Porygon2 is faster than mine. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. My Registeel is frozen but has Rest/Sleep Talk for potential recovery/stall later. Cradily is an option for physical threats but not ideal against another Porygon2. The current goal is to win the Porygon2 mirror match. I need to closely monitor HP and PP usage for both Porygon2s. If my Porygon2 gets too low, I will use Recover. If I can paralyze their Porygon2, it could give me a speed advantage for future turns, but I'll prioritize damage for now.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet.

If my Porygon2 gets too low, I will use Recover. If I can paralyze their Porygon2, it could give me a speed advantage for future turns, but I'll prioritize healing for now to ensure I don't get trapped in a knockout situation. Since I know the opponent's Porygon2 has Leftovers, I must use Recover to offset its recovery and the damage it inflicts. My goal is to win the war of attrition in this mirror match, and Recover is crucial for that.\n\nMy Quilava and opponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. My Porygon2 is frozen and heavily damaged. Registeel is also frozen. Cradily is my only usable Pokémon available. The opponent's Porygon2 has Ice Beam and Thunderbolt and Leftovers. I need to switch to Cradily to absorb the hit and hopefully thaw out my frozen Pokémon later. Cradily was previously damaged by Ice Beam (super effective). I need to re-evaluate after Cradily takes a hit. I need to observe if the opponent's Porygon2 has a third and fourth move that could threaten Cradily. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. Registeel has Rest, Sleep Talk, Toxic, and Seismic Toss. Cradily has Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, and Recover.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet. The opponent's Porygon2 is faster than mine. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. My Registeel is frozen but has Rest/Sleep Talk for potential recovery/stall later. Cradily is fainted. Currently in a 1v1 with Porygon2 vs Porygon2, both frozen. I have switched to my Porygon2. This battle is precarious as all my remaining usable Pokémon are frozen. The best strategy is to hope for a thaw on my Porygon2. If it thaws, I will need to decide between attacking for damage or using Recover to increase its longevity. Thunderbolt seems like the best offensive move due to potential Super Effective hits on future Pokemon in the opponent's team, and Ice Beam if I need to target grounded types. I need to keep an eye on their Porygon2's HP and my own; if my Porygon2 gets too low, I will use Recover. I am trying to minimize risk while dealing damage and hoping for a thaw on my frozen Pokémon.\n\nMy Quilava and opponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. My Porygon2 is frozen and heavily damaged. Registeel is also frozen. Cradily is my only usable Pokémon available. The opponent's Porygon2 has Ice Beam and Thunderbolt and Leftovers. I need to switch to Cradily to absorb the hit and hopefully thaw out my frozen Pokémon later. Cradily was previously damaged by Ice Beam (super effective). I need to re-evaluate after Cradily takes a hit. I need to observe if the opponent's Porygon2 has a third and fourth move that could threaten Cradily. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. Registeel has Rest, Sleep Talk, Toxic, and Seismic Toss. Cradily has Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, and Recover.  \n\nGiven Cradily has fainted, both my active Porygon2 and Registeel are frozen. This is a very challenging situation. My Porygon2 is at 51.87% HP, and Registeel is at 100% HP but frozen. Both are highly vulnerable. The opponent's Porygon2 is at 82% HP. Since my active Porygon2 is frozen, it can't move. The only 'move' I can make is a switch. Switching to Registeel, even though it's also frozen, is the only available reasonable action. Registeel has higher special defense and HP, so it might take the hit better than the already damaged Porygon2. I'm hoping for a thaw on either Pokemon. This will be a war of attrition if they both remain frozen. The primary win condition is for one of my Pokémon to thaw out and land effective hits. Registeel's Rest and Sleep Talk could be useful if it thaws and gets hit, allowing it to recover HP and potentially attack through Sleep Talk."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Registeel is currently frozen, but has full HP. My Porygon2 is also frozen and has only 51% HP. The opponent's Porygon2 has Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. Since Registeel resists Ice Beam, it's the more resilient choice to keep in on the field, even with the freeze status. Its higher special defense and HP pool allow it to take more hits. My only available action is to switch to my Porygon2, which is also frozen. However, since Registeel is already out, and frozen, continuing to take hits, while frozen, is bad, as it cannot act. If I switch to frozen Porygon2, at least it has a chance to thaw, and if it doesn't, it's still my other best option. The opponent will likely continue using Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. Because Porygon2 is normal type, both are neutral damage. I need to hope for a thaw to utilize Rest and Sleep Talk on Registeel, or Recover on Porygon2, or gain some offensive momentum. In this dire situation where both active Pokemon are frozen, the best move is to let Registeel take the hit, as it has more HP and a better defensive typing against the opponent's known moves.", "action": "Registeel", "scratchpad": "Opponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet. The opponent's Porygon2 is faster than mine. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. My Registeel is frozen but has Rest/Sleep Talk for potential recovery/stall later. Cradily is fainted. Currently in a 1v1 with Porygon2 vs Porygon2, both frozen. I have switched to my Porygon2, which then got frozen. Now Registeel is active and frozen. All remaining usable Pokémon are frozen. This battle is precarious as all my remaining usable Pokémon are frozen. The best strategy is to hope for a thaw on my Registeel. If it thaws, I will need to decide between attacking (Seismic Toss) or using Rest to cure the status and recover HP. If Registeel thaws, I can use Rest immediately to heal and remove the freeze. If it stays frozen, I will continue to take hits. The primary win condition is for one of my Pokémon to thaw out and land effective hits. Registeel's Rest and Sleep Talk could be useful if it thaws or gets hit, allowing it to recover HP and potentially attack through Sleep Talk. I must manage the PP of Rest/Sleep Talk carefully since Porygon2 has Leftovers recovery. My Registeel's high special defense makes it a good candidate to take hits from the opponent's Porygon2, but the freeze condition severely limits my options."}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

Key moves to watch for include Calm Mind, Softboiled/Wish, and an attacking move like Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, or Psychic. Since it's the first turn, observing its chosen move will be critical to understanding its set and role. If Clefable opts to attack, I'll need to assess damage and consider switching to a more appropriate counter, such as Cradily or Registeel, both of whom have good special bulk. If Clefable sets up, I may need to switch to Porygon2 to try and Trace its ability if it's something useful or break its setup with my own offense. Focusing on passive damage for now seems like a safe play.\n\nOpponent's Clefable is now poisoned. Its Meteor Mash might indicate a physical set, but it's more likely a mixed attacker or a physically defensive set with a primary physical attack. I will continue to observe its moves to confirm its set. Quilava's Fire Blast hits hard, and with Clefable poisoned, I should be able to wear it down. If Clefable switches, I will need to reassess based on the new opponent. I should be wary of Clefable's potential for recovery (Softboiled, Wish) or boosting moves (Calm Mind). My team has good defensive pivots in Porygon2 and Registeel for special attackers, and Cradily for physical attackers. I will keep an eye on Quilava's HP, as it took some damage from Meteor Mash.\n\nClefable is poisoned and under pressure. It's likely going to be knocked out next turn or be forced to switch. If it switches, I need to reassess based on the new opponent. If it stays in and recovers, I'll need to keep up the damage. Quilava's Fire Blast continues to be effective. I am now fairly certain Clefable is playing a more offensive or physically defensive role given Meteor Mash, but the lack of other moves makes it hard to pinpoint its exact set. I'll maintain offensive pressure to wear it down.\n\nOpponent's Clefable has fainted. Aipom is now active. Aipom is a fast, normal-type Pokémon. It is likely a physical attacker given its base stats, but its moves are currently unknown. I need to scout Aipom's moveset and item to determine the best counter. Quilava's Fire Blast will apply immediate pressure. I should consider switching to Porygon2 or Registeel if Aipom proves to be a strong physical attacker that threatens Quilava, or if it sets up with a boosting move. Cradily could also be an option against physical attackers, though Aipom's speed could be an issue. I will continue to track Quilava's HP and conserve its PP. Key information to gather this turn: Aipom's item, ability, and at least one move.\n\nMy Quilava has fainted. The opponent's Clefable is also fainted. The opponent has switched in Aipom, which has been revealed to have Double-Edge. This confirms Aipom is a physical attacker. I need to switch in a Pokemon that can tank Aipom's attacks and retaliate effectively. Cradily seems like the best choice here due to its resistance to Normal-type attacks (from being Rock/Grass) and having Rock Slide which is super effective. I need to be mindful of Aipom's potential Guts ability if it gets statused, though its ability is currently 'None'. Also, keep an eye on Aipom's item, which is currently unknown. My remaining team consists of Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage), Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing), and Registeel (special wall, stall potential). I will gather more information on Aipom's full moveset and ability as the battle progresses to refine my strategy.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 is likely a bulky special attacker or a wall. I need to scout its moves. Earthquake is a strong physical attack that Aipom will take neutral damage from. If Porygon2 is a special attacker, Cradily's high special defense will help. If Porygon2 is a physical attacker, Cradily's physical defense is decent. My remaining team consists of Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage), Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing), and Registeel (special wall, stall potential). I will continue to gather information on Porygon2's full moveset and item to refine my strategy. I should be wary of Porygon2's potential for status moves like Thunder Wave or Toxic, or recovery moves like Recover. I also need to confirm if it's a special or physical attacker, as its move 'Trace' only reveals the ability, not the move set or item. Cradily should be able to hold its own for a turn or two. If Porygon2 proves too powerful, I have Registeel, a good special wall, and my own Porygon2 as backup.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 has revealed Ice Beam, confirming it's a special attacker. Registeel is an optimal switch-in given its Steel typing and high special defense. My Porygon2 is also a good match-up against the opponent's Porygon2 given its move set of Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Recover. I will need to continue scouting Porygon2's moves, specifically if it has other coverage or status moves like Thunder Wave or Toxic. My Registeel has Rest and Sleep Talk, making it a good stall option, and Toxic to put pressure on. I will consider using Toxic on Registeel to chip away at Porygon2 and force it to use Recover more frequently, or to pressure a switch out. The current strategy is to pivot to Registeel to absorb damage and then assess the best long-term play.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 has revealed Ice Beam, confirming it's a special attacker. Registeel was switched in and then frozen by Ice Beam. My Registeel has Rest and Sleep Talk, making it a good stall option, and Toxic to put pressure on. Although Registeel is frozen, switching out to Porygon2 is the most proactive play. My Porygon2 has good special defense and offensive coverage with Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Recover for sustainability. I need to observe if the opponent's Porygon2 has other coverage moves or status moves like Thunder Wave or Toxic. My Porygon2 can apply offensive pressure and force switches or use Recover to stall out the opponent. I will aim to thaw Registeel later in the match by switching it back in when it's safe. I have two remaining Pokémon: Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing with Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, Recover) and Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage with Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, Recover). My Porygon2 should be able to handle the opponent's Porygon2 given its type neutrality and potential for super effective hits with Thunderbolt if the opponent's Porygon2 is not Electric type. Since the opponent's Porygon2 is Normal type, my Porygon2's Thunderbolt will be neutral, and Ice Beam will be neutral. The goal is to wear down their Porygon2 or force a switch. I will also monitor the opponent's remaining team composition as they are down to one revealed Pokémon.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Porygon2 is now active and has traced Cradily's Suction Cups ability. Porygon2 has revealed Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, confirming it's a special attacker. My Porygon2 is also active. The opponent's Porygon2 appears to be faster than mine. My Porygon2 took a Thunderbolt and is at 86%. I hit their Porygon2 for approximately 20% with my Thunderbolt last turn, which means it will take 2-3 more Thunderbolts to knock it out. My Porygon2 has Recover to mitigate damage. Registeel is frozen but has Rest and Sleep Talk, making it a potential late-game stall option. Cradily is available as well, but my Porygon2 is currently in the best position to handle the opponent's Porygon2. The current strategy is to try and out-damage the opponent's Porygon2. I will monitor Porygon2's HP and PP. I have two remaining Pokémon: Cradily (physical tank, Rock/Grass typing with Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, Recover) and Porygon2 (special tank, good offensive coverage with Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, Recover). I predict the opponent will continue to hit with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam. My Porygon2 is Normal type, so both are neutral. Recover could be used to heal off damage as needed. Since I know the opponent's Porygon2 has Leftovers, I need to apply consistent pressure to offset its recovery.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet. The opponent's Porygon2 is faster than mine. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. My Registeel is frozen but has Rest/Sleep Talk for potential recovery/stall later. Cradily is an option for physical threats but not ideal against another Porygon2. The current goal is to win the Porygon2 mirror match. I need to closely monitor HP and PP usage for both Porygon2s. If my Porygon2 gets too low, I will use Recover. If I can paralyze their Porygon2, it could give me a speed advantage for future turns, but I'll prioritize damage for now.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet. The opponent's Porygon2 is faster than mine. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. My Registeel is frozen but has Rest/Sleep Talk for potential recovery/stall later. Cradily is an option for physical threats but not ideal against another Porygon2. The current goal is to win the Porygon2 mirror match. I need to closely monitor HP and PP usage for both Porygon2s. If my Porygon2 gets too low, I will use Recover. If I can paralyze their Porygon2, it could give me a speed advantage for future turns, but I'll prioritize healing for now to ensure I don't get trapped in a knockout situation. Since I know the opponent's Porygon2 has Leftovers, I must use Recover to offset its recovery and the damage it inflicts. My goal is to win the war of attrition in this mirror match, and Recover is crucial for that.\n\nMy Quilava and opponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. My Porygon2 is frozen and heavily damaged. Registeel is also frozen. Cradily is my only usable Pokémon available. The opponent's Porygon2 has Ice Beam and Thunderbolt and Leftovers. I need to switch to Cradily to absorb the hit and hopefully thaw out my frozen Pokémon later. Cradily was previously damaged by Ice Beam (super effective). I need to re-evaluate after Cradily takes a hit. I need to observe if the opponent's Porygon2 has a third and fourth move that could threaten Cradily. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. Registeel has Rest, Sleep Talk, Toxic, and Seismic Toss. Cradily has Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, and Recover.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet. The opponent's Porygon2 is faster than mine. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. My Registeel is frozen but has Rest/Sleep Talk for potential recovery/stall later. Cradily is fainted. Currently in a 1v1 with Porygon2 vs Porygon2, both frozen. I have switched to my Porygon2. This battle is precarious as all my remaining usable Pokémon are frozen. The best strategy is to hope for a thaw on my Porygon2. If it thaws, I will need to decide between attacking for damage or using Recover to increase its longevity. Thunderbolt seems like the best offensive move due to potential Super Effective hits on future Pokemon in the opponent's team, and Ice Beam if I need to target grounded types. I need to keep an eye on their Porygon2's HP and my own; if my Porygon2 gets too low, I will use Recover. I am trying to minimize risk while dealing damage and hoping for a thaw on my frozen Pokémon.\n\nMy Quilava and opponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. My Porygon2 is frozen and heavily damaged. Registeel is also frozen. Cradily is my only usable Pokémon available. The opponent's Porygon2 has Ice Beam and Thunderbolt and Leftovers. I need to switch to Cradily to absorb the hit and hopefully thaw out my frozen Pokémon later. Cradily was previously damaged by Ice Beam (super effective). I need to re-evaluate after Cradily takes a hit. I need to observe if the opponent's Porygon2 has a third and fourth move that could threaten Cradily. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. Registeel has Rest, Sleep Talk, Toxic, and Seismic Toss. Cradily has Rock Slide, Earthquake, Toxic, and Recover.  \n\nGiven Cradily has fainted, both my active Porygon2 and Registeel are frozen. This is a very challenging situation. My Porygon2 is at 51.87% HP, and Registeel is at 100% HP but frozen. Both are highly vulnerable. The opponent's Porygon2 is at 82% HP. Since my active Porygon2 is frozen, it can't move. The only 'move' I can make is a switch. Switching to Registeel, even though it's also frozen, is the only available reasonable action. Registeel has higher special defense and HP, so it might take the hit better than the already damaged Porygon2. I'm hoping for a thaw on either Pokemon. This will be a war of attrition if they both remain frozen. The primary win condition is for one of my Pokémon to thaw out and land effective hits. Registeel's Rest and Sleep Talk could be useful if it thaws and gets hit, allowing it to recover HP and potentially attack through Sleep Talk.\n\nOpponent's Clefable and Aipom have fainted. Opponent's Porygon2's revealed moves are Ice Beam and Thunderbolt. It also has Leftovers. It likely does not have Recover given that my Porygon2 knows Recover and has not Traced it yet. The opponent's Porygon2 is faster than mine. My Porygon2 has Recover, Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, and Thunder Wave. My Registeel is frozen but has Rest/Sleep Talk for potential recovery/stall later. Cradily is fainted. Currently in a 1v1 with Porygon2 vs Porygon2, both frozen. I have switched to my Porygon2, which then got frozen. Now Registeel is active and frozen. All remaining usable Pokémon are frozen. This battle is precarious as all my remaining usable Pokémon are frozen. The best strategy is to hope for a thaw on my Registeel. If it thaws, I will need to decide between attacking (Seismic Toss) or using Rest to cure the status and recover HP. If Registeel thaws, I can use Rest immediately to heal and remove the freeze. If it stays frozen, I will continue to take hits. The primary win condition is for one of my Pokémon to thaw out and land effective hits. Registeel's Rest and Sleep Talk could be useful if it thaws or gets hit, allowing it to recover HP and potentially attack through Sleep Talk. I must manage the PP of Rest/Sleep Talk carefully since Porygon2 has Leftovers recovery.

Its ability is unknown, and moves are unrevealed. Omastar's Swift Swim makes Rain Dance a high-priority setup move. I will assume Lanturn uses a Special Attack and plan to switch to Tyranitar if needed in future turns, as it resists electric and can set up sandstorm if we need to remove the rain. My win condition with Omastar is to use Rain Dance and then sweep with boosted Hydro Pump. Need to be aware of any disruptive moves from Lanturn. Checking for Electric-type moves from Lanturn would be a good priority. Hidden Power (Dark) is available on Omastar but is unlikely to be super effective against Lanturn.\n\nMy Omastar fainted to an unrevealed move from Lanturn. This suggests Lanturn might have a strong super-effective move against Water/Rock types, which typically isn't the case for a pure Water/Electric type unless it has Hidden Power Grass/Ice. However, the log doesn't show any attack, just a faint. Based on the previous turn, Omastar was at 0% HP and fainted, meaning it probably fainted at the start of the turn due to a previous attack or status condition. Now I am switching in Tyranitar. My goal is to use its bulk and offensive power. Tyranitar's Sand Stream will change the weather. I need to observe Lanturn's next move and determine its full moveset and item. Tyranitar's Dragon Dance set can be very threatening once set up. I need to decide if I should attempt to set up or attack immediately. Earthquake and Rock Slide are strong STAB options. Hidden Power is also available. I will prioritze revealing more of Lanturn's set.\n\nOpponent's Lanturn revealed Thunderbolt, confirming its offensive capabilities. It has leftovers. My Tyranitar is in, setting up Sandstorm. I need to observe Lanturn's remaining moves and if it carries any coverage against Rock/Dark types (e.g., Ice Beam or Superpower). My optimal win condition is to set up multiple Dragon Dances on Tyranitar and sweep. If Lanturn switches, I can hit hard into the next Pokémon or continue to set up. If Lanturn stays in, I boost and then threaten it, potentially taking it out with a boosted Earthquake or Rock Slide if it switches into something that resists Ground.\n\nMy Omastar fainted to an unrevealed move from Lanturn, which was later identified as Thunderbolt, followed by Surf. My Tyranitar is now in, setting up Sandstorm. Lanturn has Leftovers and its observed moves are Thunderbolt and Surf. I have already used one Dragon Dance with Tyranitar, boosting its attack and speed. However, Tyranitar is at critically low HP (95/342). While another Dragon Dance would be beneficial, my current HP makes it too risky against an opponent at full health. I should prioritize taking out Lanturn. Rock Slide is super effective against Lanturn and provides the best immediate damage output. If Lanturn goes down, I gained momentum. If it survives, I need to consider switching to either Hitmonlee or Snorlax to absorb hits or continue applying pressure. Hitmonlee is a physical attacker with Choice Band, and Snorlax is a special wall with Curse. I need to observe if Lanturn has any other coverage moves against Rock/Dark types (e.g., Ice Beam or Fighting-type move). The goal is to eliminate Lanturn, as it poses a significant threat with its special attacks. Tyranitar's Lum Berry is unspent, which could be useful if Lanturn has status moves, but as of now, none have been revealed.\n\nMy Omastar and Tyranitar have fainted. Lanturn's revealed moves are Thunderbolt and Surf. Its ability is still unknown, but it carries Leftovers. It's currently at 24% HP. I'm switching in Hitmonlee, which has Choice Band, and its moves are Brick Break, Hidden Power, Rock Slide, and Mach Punch. Hitmonlee is a Fighting type. Brick Break will be super effective against any normal types that might switch in, and Rock Slide could threaten flying types. I need to observe if Lanturn switches out or attempts to attack. Mach Punch is a priority move that could be useful to finish off a low HP opponent. My main goal is to take down Lanturn. Snorlax is my last remaining Pokémon and can serve as a special wall or potentially set up with Curse if the opportunity arises. I need to ensure Hitmonlee maximizes its damage output while being mindful of Lanturn's potential remaining coverage.\n\nMy Omastar and Tyranitar have fainted.

I'm switching in Hitmonlee, which has Choice Band, and its moves are Brick Break, Hidden Power, Rock Slide, and Mach Punch. Hitmonlee is a Fighting type. Brick Break will be super effective against any normal types that might switch in, and Rock Slide could threaten flying types. I need to observe if Lanturn switches out or attempts to attack. Mach Punch is a priority move that could be useful to finish off a low HP opponent, especially given Lanturn's low health. My main goal is to take down Lanturn. Snorlax is my last remaining Pokémon and can serve as a special wall or potentially set up with Curse if the opportunity arises. I need to ensure Hitmonlee maximizes its damage output while being mindful of Lanturn's potential remaining coverage. If Mach Punch fails to KO, I'm locked into it for the next turn, which could be problematic if the opponent switches to a Ghost or Flying type. However, for now, the immediate threat is Lanturn, and securing the KO is paramount.\n\nMy Omastar and Tyranitar have fainted. Lanturn's revealed moves are Thunderbolt and Surf. Its ability is still unknown, but it carries Leftovers. It's now switched out for Suicune. Suicune is at 82% HP and has Pressure as an ability. Hitmonlee is currently locked into Mach Punch due to Choice Band. Mach Punch will not be effective against Suicune. I only have Snorlax left, a special wall, which should be able to tank hits from Suicune. Suicune is likely a special attacker, so Snorlax's high Special Defense will be beneficial. I need to consider setting up with Curse on Snorlax once it's in. My win condition is now Snorlax, focusing on setting up Curse and then sweeping. I need to be careful of any Physical attacks Suicune might carry or if it attempts to stall with Rest. Given that my opponent has revealed Lanturn and Suicune, they likely have a defensive core. My Snorlax should be able to outlast them, especially if I get a chance to set up.\n\nMy Omastar and Tyranitar have fainted. Lanturn's revealed moves are Thunderbolt and Surf. Its ability is still unknown, but it carries Leftovers. It's now switched out for Suicune. Suicune is at 82% HP and has Pressure as an ability. Hitmonlee used Mach Punch against Suicune, which wasn't effective. I then switched in Snorlax. Snorlax took a Surf from Suicune, which confirmed Suicuneเป็น a special attacker. Snorlax has significant special defense and Leftovers recovery, making it a good counter to special attackers like Suicune. My win condition is now Snorlax, focusing on setting up with Curse. Curse will raise Snorlax's Attack and Defense, making it a powerful physical attacker and a formidable wall. I will look for opportunities to use Protect to scout or recover if Suicune attempts to phaze. The opponent's team seems to be defensive, with Leftovers on both Lanturn and Suicune. Snorlax with Curse can break through defensive cores. I need to be aware of phazing moves like Roar or Whirlwind, and any potential physical attacks Suicune might carry, though unlikely.\n\nMy Omastar and Tyranitar have fainted. Lanturn's revealed moves are Thunderbolt and Surf. Its ability is still unknown, but it carries Leftovers. It's now switched out for Suicune. Suicune is at 82% HP and has Pressure as an ability. Hitmonlee attempted Mach Punch against Suicune, which wasn't very effective. I then switched in Snorlax. Snorlax took a Surf from Suicune, which confirmed Suicune is a special attacker. Snorlax has significant special defense and Leftovers recovery, making it a good counter to special attackers like Suicune. I used Curse with Snorlax, boosting its Attack and Defense, but Suicune used Roar, forcing Snorlax out. My win condition is now Snorlax, focusing on setting up with Curse.

Suicune is revealed with Surf, Roar, Pressure, and Leftovers. Snorlax is my only remaining offensive threat, a CurseLax strategy. I need to maximize Curse boosts on Snorlax. Suicune likely carries Rest and Sleep Talk / Calm Mind to further stall/boost. I need to watch for that. My Snorlax has Protect to scout for those moves. Self Destruct will be used as a last resort to take out a strong threat or remove a wall. Hitmonlee is still alive (81.4% HP) but locked into Mach Punch, making it useless against Suicune. I should not switch into Hitmonlee unless absolutely necessary as it is just setup fodder.\n\nOpponent's Lanturn is revealed with Thunderbolt, Surf, and Leftovers.

[],\n  \"switches\": [\n    \"swampert\"\n  ]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent has a Medicham. Its ability is Pure Power, making it a strong physical attacker. Groudon has a type advantage with Earthquake. Need to monitor if Medicham has a Focus Sash or other defensive items. Also need to note Medicham's speed and other potential threats on the opponent's team as they switch in.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham and Aerodactyl. Aerodactyl is immune to Ground, so Groudon's Earthquake is useless here. Aerodactyl is likely a fast physical attacker. Need to scout its moveset. Overheat is a strong play against Aerodactyl. Keep track of Groudon's Special Attack drops from Overheat if I need to use it multiple times. Medicham is a major threat due to Pure Power. Need to determine if it has a Focus Sash or other important items. Swampert could be a good counter to Medicham if it comes back in because of its bulk and Water typing against Medicham's potential Fire or Ice attacks (if it's a mixed attacker). Tyranitar's Sand Stream would remove Groudon's sun, which might be detrimental for Overheat's power. Gengar could be a good choice for speed control or status, but doesn't have a super-effective move right now.\n\nOpponent has Medicham and Aerodactyl. Aerodactyl is a fast physical attacker, immune to ground, and resisted Overheat. Medicham is a physical threat due to Pure Power. My Groudon's special attack is -2. Bringing in Tyranitar will create Sandstorm and allow for a super effective Rock Slide against Aerodactyl. I need to observe if Aerodactyl has any other moves. Swapped in Tyranitar, anticipating Aerodactyl to stay in or for Medicham to come in. Rock Slide is strong against Aerodactyl. If Medicham comes in, Tyranitar can potentially set up dragon dance or hit it with Earthquake.\n\nOpponent's Aerodactyl is at 70% health and has used Double-Edge. It's a physical attacker. It resisted Groudon's Overheat. Aerodactyl is weak to Rock-type attacks. Tyranitar can set up with Dragon Dance to boost its attack and speed. If Aerodactyl stays in, a +1 Rock Slide will be devastating. If Medicham switches in, Earthquake will be super effective. Keep an eye on Medicham's health and potential item. The sandstorm will provide passive damage. My Tyranitar holds a Lum Berry, useful for any potential status from future threats.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham and Aerodactyl. Medicham is a huge threat because of Pure Power, making it a powerful physical attacker. Tyranitar, after one Dragon Dance, is now faster than Medicham (243 Spe Tyranitar + 1 DD vs. potential 239 Spe Medicham if max speed, or slower. Assuming Medicham doesn't have a Choice Scarf). Earthquake should do significant damage, potentially OHKOing Medicham. If Medicham survives, I need to consider switching or going for another attack. Future considerations will be Aerodactyl which is weak to Rock Slide, and if any other Pokémon are revealed. My Groudon took damage and has -2 special attack from Overheat, making it less effective for now. Swampert is still healthy and an option against physical attackers or for setting up Protect. Gengar is a strong special attacker and could provide status support, if needed.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham and Aerodactyl. Medicham is a very strong physical attacker due to Pure Power. It's currently at 13% HP. Aerodactyl is a fast physical attacker, weak to Rock. My Groudon's special attack is lowered. My Tyranitar has fainted. I need to keep track of the opponent's remaining Pokémon and their movesets as they are revealed. Swampert is a good defensive pivot and offensive threat against Medicham and potentially Aerodactyl (with Ice Beam). Gengar can be a good late-game clean-up or status spreader. Need to consider potential Choice Scarf on Aerodactyl or other fast threats. My team needs to maintain momentum and chip away at the opponent's team.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham (fainted this turn if Earthquake hits) and Aerodactyl (weak to Rock, took damage from Overheat and Double-Edge recoil). Medicham is a physical attacker due to Pure Power. Aerodactyl is a fast physical attacker. My Groudon's special attack is lowered, but it is still a threat. Gengar is an unrevealed and healthy special attacker with status capabilities. Swampert is a good defensive and offensive pivot. I need to keep track of the opponent's remaining Pokémon. Aerodactyl is weak to Ice Beam, which Swampert has. This turn's Earthquake will hopefully eliminate Medicham, clearing the path to deal with Aerodactyl. If Medicham somehow survives the hit or switches, I'll reassess. The Sandstorm from Tyranitar's Sand Stream will continue to chip away health.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham and Aerodactyl. Medicham is a very strong physical attacker because of Pure Power. Medicham took damage from sandstorm to 94%, then from Swampert's Earthquake to 13%, and fainted from sandstorm. Aerodactyl is a fast physical attacker, weak to Rock and Ice. It has used Double-Edge. It resisted Groudon's Overheat. My Tyranitar has fainted. Groudon has a -2 special attack from Overheat. Swampert is healthy and can use Ice Beam against Aerodactyl. Gengar is a strong special attacker, unrevealed, and could be a good late-game cleaner. Need to continue monitoring opponent's team for other threats and potential switch-ins. Aerodactyl's item is still unknown but it resisted Overheat earlier. If Aerodactyl survives Ice Beam, it will likely try to hit Swampert with Double-Edge. Swampert is a relatively bulky Pokemon, so it should be able to take a hit. Sandstorm continues to chip away at the opponent's Pokemon.\n\nOpponent has Medicham (7% HP, likely physical attacker with Pure Power) and Aerodactyl (19% HP, fast physical attacker, weak to Ice/Rock). Aerodactyl has used Double-Edge. My Swampert is at 279/403 HP and has Ice Beam. Groudon has -2 special attack but is still a strong physical threat. Gengar is untouched and a good special attacker with status. Eliminating Aerodactyl now is the priority. After Aerodactyl, I will need to consider Medicham. Swampert is a good defensive pivot against physical attacks, and Medicham is weak to Earthquake. Groudon can also deal with Medicham if needed.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham (fainted this turn), Aerodactyl (fainted this turn), and Blissey. Blissey is a massive special wall, has Leftovers, and likely carries healing moves, status moves (such as Toxic or Thunder Wave), or special attacks. Swampert is at low HP and is not effective against Blissey. Groudon is a strong physical attacker with STAB Earthquake which will be much more effective against Blissey. Gengar is also an option, but its moveset isn't ideal for Blissey. I will switch to Groudon to apply pressure and potentially set up with Swords Dance if Blissey can't deal significant damage. Need to be aware of potential status from Blissey on Groudon. Ensure to keep track of Groudon's current health and potential recovery from Leftovers.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), and Blissey (special wall with Leftovers). My Tyranitar is fainted. Groudon has -2 special attack but its physical moves (Earthquake, Swords Dance) are unaffected. Gengar and Swampert are remaining. Groudon is the best immediate threat to Blissey with Swords Dance and Earthquake. Need to anticipate Blissey's status moves (Toxic/Thunder Wave) and plan recovery or a switch to Gengar if Groudon gets severely statused or low on health. Swampert is a useful defensive pivot, but its attacks are less effective against Blissey. I will try to set up Groudon to sweep the remaining Pokémon.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), and Blissey (special wall with Leftovers). My Tyranitar is fainted. Groudon has -2 special attack but its physical moves (Earthquake, Swords Dance) are unaffected. Gengar and Swampert are remaining. Groudon is the best immediate threat to Blissey with Swords Dance and Earthquake. I should attempt to get Groudon to +4 or +6 Attack if possible. Need to anticipate Blissey's status moves (Toxic/Thunder Wave) and plan recovery or a switch to Gengar if Groudon gets severely statused or low on health. Swampert is a useful defensive pivot, but its attacks are less effective against Blissey. After a second Swords Dance, Groudon should be able to finish Blissey with Earthquake and potentially threaten the next Pokémon.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), and Blissey (special wall with Leftovers). My Tyranitar is fainted. Groudon has -2 special attack but its physical moves (Earthquake, Swords Dance) are unaffected. Gengar and Swampert are remaining. Groudon is at +4 Attack. Blissey has Seismic Toss. After Blissey, the opponent has two unknown Pokémon. Need to predict their roles and potential threats. Groudon's Earthquake at +4 should OHKO Blissey. After Blissey, Groudon will be a major threat to the rest of the opponent's team. Keep an eye on Groudon's health and potential recovery from Leftovers. Gengar and Swampert can cover specific threats if Groudon faints.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), and Blissey (fainted). Tyranitar is fainted. Groudon has -2 special attack from earlier Overheats, but its physical moves (Earthquake, Swords Dance) are unaffected and it was at +4 Attack. Gengar and Swampert are remaining. Groudon has successfully OHKO'd Blissey with Earthquake after two Swords Dances. Opponent has switched in Shiftry. Shiftry is a Grass/Dark type, making it vulnerable to Fire-type moves. Groudon's Overheat will be boosted by the sun (Drought) and hit super-effectively. Groudon is at low HP, so a decisive move is needed. After Shiftry, I need to be careful about the next revealed Pokémon and Groudon's low HP. Gengar and Swampert are still healthy and can provide support or a late-game sweep.\n\nOpponent has revealed Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), Blissey (fainted), and now Shiftry. My Tyranitar and Groudon are fainted. Swampert and Gengar remain. Shiftry is Grass/Dark, so it's weak to Fire (Groudon's Overheat would have been amazing if it was alive), Fighting, Flying, Poison, Bug, Ice. Gengar is faster than Shiftry and carries Ice Punch. Gengar also has Thunderbolt against potential flying types. Let's see what Shiftry does. If Shiftry has Solar Beam, the sun is active so it will hit immediately. Gengar needs to hit hard and quick. Swampert can take hits, but Gengar's speed and super-effective Ice Punch are more appealing right now to maintain momentum. Need to keep an eye on Shiftry's moveset and item.\n\nOpponent's team: Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), Blissey (fainted), Shiftry (active, full health after switching in, used Solar Beam last turn). My team: Tyranitar (fainted), Groudon (fainted), Gengar (active, full health), Swampert (37% health). Shiftry is Grass/Dark type. Gengar has Ice Punch (super effective), Thunderbolt (not very effective), Willowisp (can burn), Taunt (can prevent status/setup). Given Shiftry just used Solar Beam in sun, it indicates it likely doesn't have a damaging move that isn't Solar Beam or is a special attacker. Gengar's Ice Punch should outspeed and potentially OHKO. Remaining opponent Pokémon: 2 unknown. Swampert is a safe switch if Gengar cannot handle the next threat.\n\nOpponent's team: Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), Blissey (fainted), Shiftry (active, low health, Grass/Dark type, Leftovers, Hidden Power is super effective against Gengar - likely Flying or Ground). My team: Tyranitar (fainted), Groudon (fainted), Gengar (active, very low health), Swampert (37% health). It's a 1v1 right now between Gengar and Shiftry. Gengar needs to win the speed tie and get the KO. If Shiftry outspeeds and knocks out Gengar, then it's down to Swampert against Shiftry and any remaining unknown Pokémon. Swampert is at 37% health and not ideal against Shiftry. Need to prepare for the possibility of Swampert being the last Pokémon standing. Remaining opponent Pokémon: 1 unknown. Gengar's Ice Punch is super effective, and Thunderbolt is not. Taunt and Willowisp are less relevant at this critical stage. The speed of Shiftry compared to Gengar is crucial. Gengar's speed is 308. Shiftry's speed is around 259-269 based on average specs, meaning Gengar should be faster at base. However, if Shiftry has a Choice Scarf, it could outspeed Gengar. Assuming it doesn't from the previous turns. Given Shiftry's usage of Hidden Power, rather than Solar Beam, this indicates a possible physical set, but its special attack is still a threat. The priority is to eliminate Shiftry with Ice Punch. If Gengar faints, the game relies entirely on Swampert's ability to sweep."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Gengar just fainted. I now only have Swampert left against the opponent's Shiftry, which is currently at 35% HP and has Leftovers. The opponent has 1 unknown Pokémon remaining after Shiftry. Swampert is at 37% HP. Swampert outspeeds Shiftry (140 vs unknown, but Gengar was faster than Shiftry). Shiftry is Grass/Dark, making it vulnerable to Ice-type moves. Swampert has Ice Beam, which is super effective. The sun is still up, but Swampert's Ice Beam is strong enough to potentially K.O. Shiftry. Given the critical state of the game, I need to go for the immediate threat. If Swampert faints, I lose. Therefore, Ice Beam is the only viable option to try and take out Shiftry.", "action": "icebeam", "scratchpad": "Opponent has revealed Medicham (fainted), Aerodactyl (fainted), Blissey (fainted), and Shiftry (active, low health).

If Swampert beats Shiftry, I will then face the opponent's last Pokémon with a weakened Swampert, which will be a tough challenge. Need to use Ice Beam and hope for the K.O.

Medicham's Fake Out is a strong lead to chip damage and prevent it from moving turn 1. Need to observe if Deoxys-Attack has a Focus Sash. If it survives Fake Out, I'll need to consider a stronger attack like Brick Break or a switch depending on expected moves from Deoxys-Attack for turn 2. Deoxys-Attack typically runs moves like Superpower, Psychic, Shadow Ball, or Extreme Speed. My team has Suicune (bulky, but weak to Psychic/Shadow Ball), Tyranitar (resists Psychic, vulnerable to Superpower, but can set up Sandstorm), and Deoxys-Speed (fast taunter). Medicham is currently locked into Fake Out due to Choice Band, so I'll need to prediction switch or use a damaging move next turn."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Medicham is currently locked into Fake Out due to Choice Band. However, Fake Out can only be used on the first turn the Pokémon is out. Since I used Fake Out last turn, I cannot use it again this turn. The available actions correctly reflect this, only showing Fake Out as a move option, but it's technically unusable in this scenario. My Medicham's Brick Break is super effective against Nidoking, and given Nidoking is at 60% health, it's very likely to be a KO with Pure Power and Choice Band. Since Nidoking already took Fake Out damage, and is not a huge threat to Medicham, I want to take it out now. There's no immediate threat prompting a switch, and maintaining momentum by KOing the opponent's active Pokemon is a strong play.", "action": "brickbreak", "scratchpad": "Opponent has a Deoxys-Attack and Nidoking. Nidoking took 40% from Fake Out. My Medicham is Choice Banded. Nidoking is down to 60% HP. Brick Break is super effective and should KO. After Nidoking, I'll need to prepare for Deoxys-Attack. Tyranitar can switch into Psychic from Deoxys-Attack. Suicune can be a bulky wall against some moves. Deoxys-Speed can Taunt. I'll need to consider what item Nidoking has and what moves it knows if it survives this turn. Given it switched into Deoxys-Attack, it might be a special attacker or a mixed attacker with coverage options. My Medicham's speed is 259, Nidoking's unknown.

Medicham with Choice Band and Pure Power hits extremely hard. Fake Out is priority and guarantees a hit on turn 1 to gather information and deal damage. Deoxys-A has very low defenses, so even Fake Out should do significant damage. Need to identify its item and moveset. Consider switching to Tyranitar later if it's a Psychic-type attacker or Suicune if it's special.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out, confirming its frailty. Gengar is now out. Gengar is immune to Fake Out. Medicham is locked into Fake Out, making it useless this turn. Switching to Tyranitar will bring in sandstorm, dealing chip damage and boosting Tyranitar's special defense. Tyranitar also resists Gengar's common STAB moves (Ghost, Poison) and can threaten it with super-effective Earthquake or Dark-type moves if Gengar carries Psychic. Need to be wary of Gengar's moveset, especially Will-O-Wisp, Explode, or status. Suicune could also be an option for its special bulk but Tyranitar offers more offensive pressure and weather control.\n\nOpponent's Gengar has Leftovers and Ice Punch. It outsped and froze my Tyranitar, indicating it has considerable speed or a Choice Scarf. Now that Tyranitar is out of the game for this turn, switching to Suicune is optimal. Suicune resists Ice Punch and has good special bulk. I need to observe Gengar's next move to determine if it's a special attacker (e.g., Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass/Fire, Sludge Bomb) or a physical one (e.g., Focus Punch, Shadow Ball if it's mixed). Suicune can set up Calm Minds or pressure with Surf. If Gengar appears to be physical, I should be wary of Focus Punch. My Tyranitar lost its Lum Berry, so I need to watch for further status conditions like burn or sleep. Deoxys-Attack was confirmed frail; I need to remember that for later if they have another Deoxys forme.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out, confirming its frailty. Gengar is out. Gengar is immune to Fake Out. Medicham is locked into Fake Out. Tyranitar came in and set up Sandstorm but was frozen by Gengar's Ice Punch, indicating Gengar is fast and likely running a physical move for coverage or a mixed set. Tyranitar lost its Lum Berry. Suicune is now in against Gengar. Suicune resisted Ice Punch, took Sandstorm damage, and healed with Leftovers. Gengar has Leftovers as well. Suicune should try to set up Calm Minds. Need to watch for Gengar's other moves, especially special attacks (Thunderbolt, Sludge Bomb, HP Grass/Fire), Will-O-Wisp, Focus Punch, or Explode. Suicune's current plan is to use Calm Mind to boost its special stats and then potentially sweep with Surf or Roar away threats. Considering Gengar's good speed, it might be Choice Scarf, or simply faster than my Suicune. I need to be careful about being locked into a boosting move if Gengar has a super-effective special attack that can break through unboosted. However, considering Ice Punch did minimal damage, Calm Mind seems safe for now.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out, confirming its frailty. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It used Ice Punch on Tyranitar (froze it, Lum Berry consumed) and Thunderbolt on Suicune. This confirms Gengar is a mixed or special attacker and likely fast (possibly Choice Scarf or max speed). Gengar's moves seen: Ice Punch, Thunderbolt. Suicune has started setting up Calm Minds. Suicune took significant damage from Thunderbolt but survived due to its natural bulk and a Calm Mind boost. Using Rest next turn is crucial to fully heal and prepare for further setup or attacking. Once Suicune is fully healed, it can continue to Calm Mind or use Surf. Gengar's HP is being chipped by Sandstorm. My Medicham and Tyranitar are available, as is Deoxys-Speed for potential late-game cleanup or disruption. Suicune is currently the best answer to Gengar and potentially other special attackers the opponent might have.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It used Ice Punch on Tyranitar (froze it, Lum Berry consumed) and Thunderbolt on Suicune. This confirms Gengar is a mixed or special attacker and likely fast (possibly Choice Scarf or max speed). Gengar's moves seen: Ice Punch, Thunderbolt. Suicune used Calm Mind and then Rest, recovering to full health but is now asleep. Gengar's HP is being chipped by Sandstorm. My Medicham and Tyranitar are available, as is Deoxys-Speed for potential late-game cleanup or disruption. Tyranitar is a good switch-in to Gengar as it resists Gengar's potential Ghost STAB and is neutral to Thunderbolt, while maintaining Sandstorm and threatening with Earthquake or another attack. After switching to Tyranitar, I need to observe Gengar's next move. If Gengar switches, I can predict its next move, or use Dragon Dance with Tyranitar to set up. If Gengar stays in, I will choose between Rock Slide and Earthquake. I also need to track Suicune's sleep turns. Gengar could have Focus Punch, so I need to be careful if it attempts to set up a substitute or if it anticipates a switch.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for 2 more turns from Rest (current turn is 1 of 3). Tyranitar is at 52% HP. Gengar is at 100% HP due to Leftovers. Tyranitar's Sand Stream provides passive damage to Gengar. My Medicham is healthy but locked into Fake Out. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar has taken three turns of sandstorm damage now. Earthquake should be super effective on Gengar. I need to be careful about Gengar potentially carrying Focus Punch or another coverage move. If Gengar has a Choice Scarf, it was locked into Thunderbolt which Tyranitar resisted. However, it still did significant damage. If it's not locked into Thunderbolt and carries Focus Punch/Explosion, I need to anticipate that in future turns. For now, hitting with Earthquake is the best bet to keep offensive pressure and potentially remove Gengar.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for 2 more turns from Rest (current turn is 1 of 3). Tyranitar is at 32.75% HP. Gengar is at 100% HP due to Leftovers. Tyranitar's Sand Stream provides passive damage to Gengar. My Medicham is healthy but locked into Fake Out. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar is immune to Earthquake due to Levitate. Rock Slide or Hidden Power Dark are super effective against Gengar. I must account for Gengar's potential coverage moves that might be super effective against Tyranitar (e.g., Focus Blast). If Gengar is Choice Scarfed and locked into Thunderbolt, switching to Medicham might be an option, but Medicham is frail. Rock Slide is the best offensive option here. If Tyranitar goes down, I'll need to consider how to wake up Suicune or bring in another offensive threat like Medicham.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Earthquake. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for two more turns from Rest (turn 2 of 3 next turn after healing). Tyranitar is extremely low on health. My Medicham is healthy but locked into Fake Out. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar is at around 39% health and will take more Sandstorm damage. Rock Slide is the correct play against Gengar. After Gengar is dealt with, I need to focus on waking up Suicune or cleaning up with Medicham or Deoxys-Speed depending on the opponent's next Pokémon.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail and fainted. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Earthquake. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for two more turns from Rest (turn 2 of 3 next turn after healing). Tyranitar has fainted. Medicham is healthy and can come in to finish Gengar. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar is at around 39% health and just took Sandstorm damage. Medicham's Brick Break or Rock Slide will likely finish Gengar. Once Gengar is dealt with, I need to focus on waking up Suicune or having Medicham/Deoxys-Speed handle the opponent's next Pokémon. The opponent only has one other Pokémon remaining according to current observations.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail and fainted. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers.

Gengar is at 39% HP and will take more Sandstorm damage at the end of the turn. Medicham is faster than Gengar and carries Pure Power with a Choice Band, meaning its physical attacks are extremely powerful. Gengar is immune to Brick Break because it is a Ghost/Poison type, making Fighting-type attacks ineffective. However, Medicham also knows Shadow Ball, which would be super effective, or Rock Slide, which is neutral but still hits hard. Given that Gengar is at such low health, Shadow Ball is the optimal move to secure the knockout due to its super-effective typing against Ghost.

Medicham with Choice Band and Pure Power hits extremely hard. Fake Out is priority and guarantees a hit on turn 1 to gather information and deal damage. Deoxys-A has very low defenses, so even Fake Out should do significant damage. Need to identify its item and moveset. Consider switching to Tyranitar later if it's a Psychic-type attacker or Suicune if it's special.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out, confirming its frailty. Gengar is now out. Gengar is immune to Fake Out. Medicham is locked into Fake Out, making it useless this turn. Switching to Tyranitar will bring in sandstorm, dealing chip damage and boosting Tyranitar's special defense. Tyranitar also resists Gengar's common STAB moves (Ghost, Poison) and can threaten it with super-effective Earthquake or Dark-type moves if Gengar carries Psychic. Need to be wary of Gengar's moveset, especially Will-O-Wisp, Explode, or status. Suicune could also be an option for its special bulk but Tyranitar offers more offensive pressure and weather control.\n\nOpponent's Gengar has Leftovers and Ice Punch. It outsped and froze my Tyranitar, indicating it has considerable speed or a Choice Scarf. Now that Tyranitar is out of the game for this turn, switching to Suicune is optimal. Suicune resists Ice Punch and has good special bulk. I need to observe Gengar's next move to determine if it's a special attacker (e.g., Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Grass/Fire, Sludge Bomb) or a physical one (e.g., Focus Punch, Shadow Ball if it's mixed). Suicune can set up Calm Minds or pressure with Surf. If Gengar appears to be physical, I should be wary of Focus Punch. My Tyranitar lost its Lum Berry, so I need to watch for further status conditions like burn or sleep. Deoxys-Attack was confirmed frail; I need to remember that for later if they have another Deoxys forme.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out, confirming its frailty. Gengar is out. Gengar is immune to Fake Out. Medicham is locked into Fake Out. Tyranitar came in and set up Sandstorm but was frozen by Gengar's Ice Punch, indicating Gengar is fast and likely running a physical move for coverage or a mixed set. Tyranitar lost its Lum Berry. Suicune is now in against Gengar. Suicune resisted Ice Punch, took Sandstorm damage, and healed with Leftovers. Gengar has Leftovers as well. Suicune should try to set up Calm Minds. Need to watch for Gengar's other moves, especially special attacks (Thunderbolt, Sludge Bomb, HP Grass/Fire), Will-O-Wisp, Focus Punch, or Explode. Suicune's current plan is to use Calm Mind to boost its special stats and then potentially sweep with Surf or Roar away threats. Considering Gengar's good speed, it might be Choice Scarf, or simply faster than my Suicune. I need to be careful about being locked into a boosting move if Gengar has a super-effective special attack that can break through unboosted. However, considering Ice Punch did minimal damage, Calm Mind seems safe for now.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out, confirming its frailty. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It used Ice Punch on Tyranitar (froze it, Lum Berry consumed) and Thunderbolt on Suicune. This confirms Gengar is a mixed or special attacker and likely fast (possibly Choice Scarf or max speed). Gengar's moves seen: Ice Punch, Thunderbolt. Suicune has started setting up Calm Minds. Suicune took significant damage from Thunderbolt but survived due to its natural bulk and a Calm Mind boost. Using Rest next turn is crucial to fully heal and prepare for further setup or attacking. Once Suicune is fully healed, it can continue to Calm Mind or use Surf. Gengar's HP is being chipped by Sandstorm. My Medicham and Tyranitar are available, as is Deoxys-Speed for potential late-game cleanup or disruption. Suicune is currently the best answer to Gengar and potentially other special attackers the opponent might have.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack was knocked out by Fake Out. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It used Ice Punch on Tyranitar (froze it, Lum Berry consumed) and Thunderbolt on Suicune. This confirms Gengar is a mixed or special attacker and likely fast (possibly Choice Scarf or max speed). Gengar's moves seen: Ice Punch, Thunderbolt. Suicune used Calm Mind and then Rest, recovering to full health but is now asleep. Gengar's HP is being chipped by Sandstorm. My Medicham and Tyranitar are available, as is Deoxys-Speed for potential late-game cleanup or disruption. Tyranitar is a good switch-in to Gengar as it resists Gengar's potential Ghost STAB and is neutral to Thunderbolt, while maintaining Sandstorm and threatening with Earthquake or another attack. After switching to Tyranitar, I need to observe Gengar's next move. If Gengar switches, I can predict its next move, or use Dragon Dance with Tyranitar to set up. If Gengar stays in, I will choose between Rock Slide and Earthquake. I also need to track Suicune's sleep turns. Gengar could have Focus Punch, so I need to be careful if it attempts to set up a substitute or if it anticipates a switch.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for 2 more turns from Rest (current turn is 1 of 3). Tyranitar is at 52% HP. Gengar is at 100% HP due to Leftovers. Tyranitar's Sand Stream provides passive damage to Gengar. My Medicham is healthy but locked into Fake Out. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar has taken three turns of sandstorm damage now. Earthquake should be super effective on Gengar. I need to be careful about Gengar potentially carrying Focus Punch or another coverage move. If Gengar has a Choice Scarf, it was locked into Thunderbolt which Tyranitar resisted. However, it still did significant damage. If it's not locked into Thunderbolt and carries Focus Punch/Explosion, I need to anticipate that in future turns. For now, hitting with Earthquake is the best bet to keep offensive pressure and potentially remove Gengar.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for 2 more turns from Rest (current turn is 1 of 3). Tyranitar is at 32.75% HP. Gengar is at 100% HP due to Leftovers. Tyranitar's Sand Stream provides passive damage to Gengar. My Medicham is healthy but locked into Fake Out. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar is immune to Earthquake due to Levitate. Rock Slide or Hidden Power Dark are super effective against Gengar. I must account for Gengar's potential coverage moves that might be super effective against Tyranitar (e.g., Focus Blast). If Gengar is Choice Scarfed and locked into Thunderbolt, switching to Medicham might be an option, but Medicham is frail. Rock Slide is the best offensive option here. If Tyranitar goes down, I'll need to consider how to wake up Suicune or bring in another offensive threat like Medicham.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Earthquake. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for two more turns from Rest (turn 2 of 3 next turn after healing). Tyranitar is extremely low on health. My Medicham is healthy but locked into Fake Out. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar is at around 39% health and will take more Sandstorm damage. Rock Slide is the correct play against Gengar. After Gengar is dealt with, I need to focus on waking up Suicune or cleaning up with Medicham or Deoxys-Speed depending on the opponent's next Pokémon.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail and fainted. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Earthquake. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for two more turns from Rest (turn 2 of 3 next turn after healing). Tyranitar has fainted. Medicham is healthy and can come in to finish Gengar. Deoxys-Speed is untouched. Gengar is at around 39% health and just took Sandstorm damage. Medicham's Brick Break or Rock Slide will likely finish Gengar. Once Gengar is dealt with, I need to focus on waking up Suicune or having Medicham/Deoxys-Speed handle the opponent's next Pokémon. The opponent only has one other Pokémon remaining according to current observations.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail and fainted. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Earthquake. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker.

It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Earthquake. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for two more turns from Rest (turn 2 of 3 next turn after healing). Tyranitar has fainted. Medicham is now active against Gengar. Medicham needs to use a super effective or strong neutral move to finish Gengar. Medicham's Shadow Ball is super effective against Gengar. After Gengar is dealt with, I need to focus on waking up Suicune or having Medicham/Deoxys-Speed handle the opponent's next Pokémon. The opponent only has one other Pokémon remaining according to current observations. The primary goal is to take out Gengar and then assess the final Pokémon. I need to be careful with Medicham's Choice Band locks if the next opponent's pokemon resists Shadow Ball.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is confirmed frail and fainted. Gengar is out and confirmed to have Leftovers. It knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar's Levitate makes it immune to Earthquake. Gengar is likely fast (Choice Scarf or max speed) and a special attacker. My Suicune is asleep for two more turns from Rest (turn 2 of 3 next turn after healing). Tyranitar has fainted. Medicham is at extremely low HP and will likely faint this turn. Deoxys-Speed is untouched and is being switched in. Gengar is at around 39% health and took Sandstorm damage again this turn. Deoxys-Speed's stats provide good speed and defensive capabilities, though its special defense is not its strongest point. I need to assess Gengar's remaining health after Sandstorm and determine if Deoxys-Speed can safely take a hit. Deoxys-Speed has Taunt, Toxic, Knock Off, and Recover, offering good utility and stallbreaking potential. Once Gengar is dealt with (either by Sandstorm or Deoxys-Speed), I need to focus on waking up Suicune or having Deoxys-Speed handle the opponent's final Pokémon. The opponent only has one other Pokémon remaining, so predicting its role and moveset will be crucial for the endgame.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar has Leftovers, Ice Punch, and Thunderbolt. Gengar is fast. My Suicune is asleep for one more turn. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at extremely low HP. Deoxys-Speed is active and has 76% HP. Gengar is at 39% HP and takes Sandstorm damage. Deoxys-Speed can outspeed Gengar. My goal is to finish Gengar and then deal with the opponent's final Pokémon. Toxic on Gengar is the best option now to ensure it faints quickly through residual damage. If Gengar switches, the new Pokémon will be Toxiced, which is also beneficial. Need to consider potential Explosion from Gengar. If Gengar uses Explosion, Deoxys-Speed would likely survive with its good Defenses. After Gengar is gone, I need to assess what the opponent's final Pokémon is and plan accordingly with Suicune (once it wakes up), Medicham, or Deoxys-Speed.\n\nOpponent has revealed Nidoking. It is immune to Toxic, suggesting it is either a Poison-type or has an ability like Poison Point. It is currently at 100% HP. My Deoxys-Speed has 76% HP and outspeeds Nidoking. Gengar is at low HP (39%) and still taking Sandstorm damage. Knock Off is the best move to apply pressure and gather information on Nidoking's item. Suicune is asleep for one more turn. Medicham is basically knocked out. After dealing with Nidoking, Gengar needs to be handled. I need to keep track of Nidoking's moveset, as it might carry powerful physical or special attacks, or even setup. My primary goal is to take down Nidoking, then Gengar, and manage Suicune's awakening for the late game.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar has lost its Leftovers and knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is fast. My Suicune is asleep for one more turn. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at extremely low HP. Deoxys-Speed is active and has 76% HP. Gengar is at low HP (21%) and still taking Sandstorm damage. Nidoking is also present in the opponent's team and has a Toxic immunity. My goal is to finish Gengar and then deal with the opponent's final Pokémon (Nidoking). Recovering health with Deoxys-Speed ensures longevity and makes it a more potent threat for the endgame. After Gengar is dealt with, I need to assess Nidoking's moveset and plan accordingly with Deoxys-Speed, Suicune (once it awakens), or Medicham (if it somehow survives).\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar has lost its Leftovers and knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is fast. My Suicune is asleep for one more turn. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at extremely low HP. Deoxys-Speed is active and at 74% HP. Gengar is at low HP (15%) and will take Sandstorm damage. Nidoking is also present in the opponent's team and has a Toxic immunity. My goal is to finish Gengar and then deal with the opponent's Nidoking. Recovering health with Deoxys-Speed ensures longevity and makes it a more potent threat for the endgame. After Gengar is dealt with, I need to assess Nidoking's moveset and plan accordingly with Deoxys-Speed, Suicune (once it awakens), or Medicham (if it somehow survives). Deoxys-Speed is primarily a utility Pokémon with Taunt, Toxic (now confirmed useless against Nidoking), Knock Off, and Recover. Its high speed allows it to outspeed most threats. This turn, recovering seems to be the optimal play to keep Deoxys-Speed healthy and outlast Gengar, then focus on Nidoking. Given Gengar's low HP, it may be forced to switch to Nidoking, which would then be vulnerable to Knock Off or Taunt. I have a Leftovers on Deoxys-Speed, so Recover and Leftovers will help keep it healthy.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar has lost its Leftovers and knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is fast. My Suicune is asleep for one more turn. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at extremely low HP. Deoxys-Speed is active and at 68% HP. Gengar is at low HP (9%) and will take Sandstorm damage. Nidoking is also present in the opponent's team and has a Toxic immunity. My goal is to finish Gengar and then deal with the opponent's Nidoking. Recovering health with Deoxys-Speed ensures longevity and makes it a more potent threat for the endgame.

Given Gengar's low HP, it may be forced to switch to Nidoking, which would then be vulnerable to Knock Off or Taunt. I have a Leftovers on Deoxys-Speed, so Recover and Leftovers will help keep it healthy. Gengar will likely faint from Sandstorm, or if it attacks, Deoxys-Speed will recover.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar has lost its Leftovers and knows Ice Punch and Thunderbolt. Gengar is fast. My Suicune is asleep for one more turn. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at extremely low HP. Deoxys-Speed is active and at 76% HP. Gengar is at critically low HP (2%) and will take Sandstorm damage. Nidoking is also present in the opponent's team and has a Toxic immunity. My goal is to finish Gengar (which will happen from Sandstorm) and then deal with the opponent's Nidoking. Recovering health with Deoxys-Speed ensures longevity and makes it a more potent threat for the endgame. After Gengar is dealt with, I need to assess Nidoking's moveset and plan accordingly with Deoxys-Speed, Suicune (once it awakens), or Medicham (if it somehow survives). Deoxys-Speed is primarily a utility Pokémon with Taunt, Toxic (now confirmed useless against Nidoking), Knock Off, and Recover. Its high speed allows it to outspeed most threats. This turn, recovering is the optimal play to keep Deoxys-Speed healthy and outlast Gengar, then focus on Nidoking. Gengar will likely faint from Sandstorm, or if it attacks, Deoxys-Speed will recover. Next turn, I will face Nidoking. I need to observe Nidoking's actions to determine its set and best course of action (e.g., Knock Off to remove item, Taunt to prevent setup/status, or Toxic if it's not immune, though already confirmed immune to Toxic).\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar is fainted. Nidoking is still in the opponent's team. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at critically low HP. Suicune is asleep for one more turn. Deoxys-Speed is active. Electrode is now out at full HP. Need to identify Electrode's item and full moveset. Taunt helps prevent setup. After Taunt, I will consider Knock Off for item removal or Toxic if Electrode lacks immunity (though it probably does not due to being Electric type). Suicune will wake up soon and can be critical for cleanup or a defensive pivot. Next turn, I will reconsider the optimal move against Electrode, potentially using Knock Off to remove its item or Toxic if it's a defensive set that doesn't have an immunity. Nidoking is still a threat to consider after Electrode.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar is fainted. Nidoking and Electrode remain. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at critically low HP. Suicune is asleep for one more turn. Deoxys-Speed is active and at 34.87% HP. Electrode is Taunted. Electrode hit Deoxys-Speed with Thunderbolt. After Recover, I'll reassess Electrode's item and move (if any beyond Thunderbolt) and consider Knock Off or a switch into Suicune once it wakes up. Nidoking is still a threat, and I need to keep its Toxic immunity in mind. Deoxys-Speed's high speed and utility moves are crucial for controlling the game. Need to identify Electrode's item as well. If Electrode only has Thunderbolt, then Deoxys-Speed can recover stall it and then take it down slowly or switch to a better matchup (Suicune when it wakes up).\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar is fainted. Nidoking and Electrode remain. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is at critically low HP. Suicune is asleep for one more turn. Deoxys-Speed is active and at 47.37% HP. Electrode was Taunted but the Taunt has worn off this turn. Electrode hit Deoxys-Speed with Thunderbolt, causing paralysis. I need to identify Electrode's item and full moveset. Next turn, I will either try to finish Electrode with Medicham or, if Medicham faints, reassess with Suicune (once it wakes up). Nidoking is still a threat, and I need to keep its Toxic immunity in mind. Deoxys-Speed's high speed and utility moves are crucial for controlling the game. Medicham will likely go down, but it can take Electrode with it, clearing the path for Suicune to handle Nidoking.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar is fainted. Nidoking and Electrode remain. My Tyranitar is fainted. Medicham is fainted. Suicune is asleep for one more turn. Deoxys-Speed is active and at 47.37% HP and paralyzed. Electrode is active and at 100% HP, with Leftovers, and knows Thunderbolt. It is no longer Taunted. I had to switch in Deoxys-Speed. My priority now is to heal Deoxys-Speed, either through Recover or Leftovers. I need to observe Electrode's next move. If Electrode continues to attack with Thunderbolt, I can attempt to recover. If Electrode switches, I must be ready for Nidoking. I need to decide between trying to heal Deoxys-Speed or switching into Suicune when it wakes up. Suicune will be fully rested and a strong defensive pivot. However, Electrode might be able to damage Suicune if it carries a super-effective move. Given Deoxys-Speed's paralysis, its speed advantage is mitigated, but it still offers utility in Taunt/Knock Off. My primary goal is to outlast Electrode and then deal with Nidoking, potentially with a fully rested Suicune.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar is fainted. Nidoking and Electrode remain.

My primary goal is to outlast Electrode and then deal with Nidoking, potentially with a fully rested Suicune. Once Suicune wakes up, it becomes a strong option for handling Electrode and potentially Nidoking due to its bulk and offensive presence. I will continue to try and recover with Deoxys-Speed while considering the paralysis factor and hoping for a full recovery for Suicune next turn. I also need to be mindful of Electrode's other moves, as only Thunderbolt has been revealed so far.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Attack is fainted. Gengar is fainted. My Tyranitar is fainted.

Unknown item and moveset. Common Heracross sets include Choice Band (Megahorn/Close Combat/Rock Slide/Earthquake) or Salac Berry/Bulk Up. Jirachi is faster than standard Heracross but slower than Scarf Heracross. Calm Mind was used to boost Special Attack and Special Defense. This prepares Jirachi to sweep later if Heracross switches or to tank hits. Need to identify Heracross's item and full moveset in upcoming turns. Prioritize keeping Jirachi healthy for a potential sweep. My team has Arcanine (Intimidate, physical attacker), Metagross (Choice Band, physical attacker, resists fighting), and Blissey (special wall, cleric). Metagross could be a good switch if Heracross reveals a fighting or grass move. Blissey can wall special attackers. Arcanine offers Intimidate, which would be useful against Heracross.\n\nOpponent's Heracross switched out, indicating it might not want to take a boosted special hit, or it anticipates a different move. Flygon is out. Its item is unknown. Flygon is weak to Ice. Jirachi's Ice Punch is a good option here. If Flygon takes significant damage, it might be forced to switch again, giving me another opportunity to set up or chip away at its team. I need to observe Flygon's moves, item, and potential strategy (e.g., Choice Scarf, Choice Band, bulky attacker). If Flygon is faster, it might indicate a Choice Scarf. If it hits hard, it could be Choice Band or a setup. My Jirachi has +1 SpA and SpD. My team has Metagross which resists Dragon. Blissey is a special wall. Arcanine has Intimidate for physical attackers.\n\nMy Jirachi is at low health, but had a +1 SpA and SpD boost. It knocked out Flygon. The opponent sent out Cradily, a grass/rock type. I need to observe Cradily's moveset and item to determine its role (e.g., Toxic staller, setup sweeper, or support). My Active Metagross should be able to resist hits and deal damage. Arcanine has Intimidate and could be useful against physical threats, while Blissey can wall special attackers and provide recovery with Softboiled. Cradily is often a defensive Pokémon, so I should be wary of status conditions like Toxic and set-up moves like Curse. Metagross's Choice Band means I need to make calculated predictions about Cradily's next move. If Cradily is a special attacker, Metagross's high Defense will be helpful. If it's a physical attacker, Intimidate from Arcanine might have been better, but Metagross still has good physical bulk. I need to scout Cradily's moves. My long-term goal is to preserve Jirachi for a potential late-game sweep.\n\nOpponent's Cradily is a Grass/Rock type, weak to Steel and Fighting. My Metagross is Choice Banded. Cradily used Toxic, which Metagross is immune to, suggesting Cradily is a defensive Pokémon (status user, potentially with recovery or setup like Curse/Acid Armor). Meteor Mash is super effective. I need to observe if Cradily has a way to deal with Metagross (e.g., HP Fire, Earthquake, status moves not resisted). My Jirachi is low HP but has +1 SpA/SpD and can be a late-game cleaner. Blissey is a special wall. Arcanine has Intimidate and could assist against physical threats. The current turn should focus on exploiting the type advantage with Meteor Mash while Metagross is healthy.\n\nMy Metagross (Choice Band) is facing Heracross. I've already eliminated Flygon and Cradily. Heracross's item is still unknown. Common Heracross sets are Choice Band or Salac Berry/Bulk Up. Meteor Mash is a strong, STAB move. If Heracross is Choice Banded and locks into a Fighting move, Metagross resists it. If it locks into Megahorn, it will hit Metagross for neutral damage, but Metagross's defenses are good. My Jirachi is at low HP but could potentially sweep later if it gets another chance to set up. Arcanine has Intimidate, which would be useful against Heracross. Blissey is a special wall. I need to observe Heracross's response to Meteor Mash to gather more information, such as its item (e.g., if it takes recoil from Life Orb) or held item, especially if it gets knocked out or takes significant damage. I will stick with Metagross to maintain offensive presence."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Metagross (Choice Band) is currently facing the opponent's newly switched-in Hitmontop. Hitmontop's Intimidate ability activated, but Metagross's Clear Body prevented the Attack drop. Metagross has a +1 Attack boost from its Meteor Mash last turn. Hitmontop is a Fighting-type Pokemon. Metagross, being Steel/Psychic, resists Fighting-type attacks. Earthquake is a powerful Ground-type move that Metagross has, and it will be super effective against Hitmontop. Given Metagross is Choice Banded and has a +1 Attack boost, Earthquake will likely deal significant damage, potentially even OHKOing Hitmontop. There is no immediate threat to Metagross on this turn, as its resistances and boosted attack make it a strong offensive presence. Switching out would lose the Choice Band lock and potentially weaken my offensive pressure, and there's no immediate need to switch given the favorable typing. My other available Pokémon are Jirachi (low HP), Arcanine (would also resist Fighting but is slower and might not have the same immediate offensive power), and Blissey (passive special wall). Therefore, attacking with Earthquake is the optimal move to try and eliminate this threat and maintain momentum.", "action": "earthquake", "scratchpad": "Opponent's team consists of Hitmontop remaining. So far, Flygon, Cradily, and Heracross have been defeated. Hitmontop's ability is Intimidate. Its item and moveset are unknown. Common Hitmontop sets include Technician (Bullet Punch) and various STAB moves like Mach Punch, Close Combat, and Sucker Punch. Given Metagross's current +1 Attack boost and Choice Band, Earthquake is a strong Super Effective option. Need to be aware of potential priority moves from Hitmontop if it survives. My Jirachi is at low HP but could be a late-game cleaner. Arcanine could provide another Intimidate and potentially outspeed Hitmontop, but Metagross's current position is too strong to give up. Blissey is a special wall for later. The goal is to continue applying offensive pressure and eliminate the remaining threat."}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

It is a Water/Rock type. Deoxys-A can outspeed and hit hard with Superpower. Omastar's ability is currently unknown. Need to watch for potential switches and entry hazards.\n\nDeoxys-Attack's Superpower debuffs (-1 Atk, -1 Def) need to be managed. Medicham is at 54% HP and has Pure Power, making it dangerous if allowed to attack. Opponent's Omastar is still an unknown threat with potential entry hazards. Electabuzz and Mantine on my team can be good switch-ins depending on what the opponent brings out next. I should monitor Medicham's item and full moveset if it survives.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is out. It is a Water/Rock type. Medicham was fainted. Deoxys-A has -1 Atk, -1 Def. Omastar's ability is currently unknown, but Swift Swim is common. Its item is also unknown. Need to discover Omastar's moveset, especially if it has entry hazards or set-up moves like Shell Smash. Electabuzz or Mantine could be potential switch-ins later, depending on Omastar's revealed moves. Shadow Ball is chosen to gather more information and avoid further stat drops, while still dealing neutral special damage. If Omastar is a special tank, this may not be optimal, but it is the safest initial play given the current boost situation.\n\nDeoxys-Attack is fainted. Opponent's Omastar is at 74% HP and has Ice Beam as a known move. Omastar's ability is unknown, but Swift Swim is a common threat. Its item is also unknown. I need to scout Omastar's full moveset and ability. Mantine is a good switch here to potentially absorb a Water-type attack. Golem would be hit super critically by any Water or Rock move, and Electabuzz is also a potential good switch in, resisting Water, but Mantine has Water Absorb which could be invaluable if Omastar has a strong Water STAB. Should observe Omastar's next move to determine if it has Rock STAB, set-up, or further coverage. My Golem is Choice Banded and has Earthquake and Rock Slide, which could be useful against other threats later.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is a Water/Rock type with Leftovers. Known move: Ice Beam. Last seen at 80% HP. Its ability is still unknown, but Swift Swim is a significant threat. Mantine is currently out, resisting Ice Beam and potentially absorbing Water-type moves. I need to observe if Omastar has any Rock-type STAB or setup moves like Shell Smash. If Omastar has a powerful Rock-type move like Rock Slide or Ancient Power, Mantine will be in danger. After applying Toxic, I will monitor Omastar's actions. If it appears to be setting up, I can use Haze. If it primarily attacks, Toxic will wear it down. My Golem is a strong physical attacker but is extremely vulnerable to Water/Rock attacks from Omastar. Electabuzz resists Water but is neutral to Rock and Ice. My primary goal now is to put pressure on Omastar and gather more information about its full moveset and ability.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is Water/Rock type, poisoned, and has Leftovers. Known move: Ice Beam. Ability is still unknown (potential Swift Swim, which would mean it outspeeds Mantine). Item is Leftovers. Mantine resists Ice Beam and is immune to Water because of Water Absorb. The primary threat from Omastar is a Rock-type STAB move or Shell Smash. I will continue to attack with Surf to keep the pressure on and wear it down with Toxic. If Omastar attempts to set up with Shell Smash, I can use Haze on the following turn to remove its stat boosts. I need to keep Golem and Electabuzz healthy for the remaining unknown Pokémon on the opponent's team. My Mantine's current health (84.43%) is good, and Leftovers will help sustain it. I will re-evaluate on the next turn based on Omastar's action.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is Water/Rock type, poisoned, and holding Leftovers. Known moves: Ice Beam, Hydro Pump. Ability is still unknown (potential Swift Swim). Mantine resists Ice Beam and is immune to Water via Water Absorb. Omastar's current HP is critically low (31%). Continuing with Surf is the best strategy to eliminate Omastar this turn. Once Omastar is down, I will re-evaluate my team's position versus the opponent's remaining Pokémon and strategize based on what they bring in next. Golem and Electabuzz are still healthy, so I need to preserve them for future threats. I need to be careful of any potential Rock-type STAB from Omastar if it somehow survives, but given its HP and Toxic, it's unlikely.\n\nOpponent's Omastar and Medicham have fainted. Misdreavus is an unknown threat with Levitate. My Deoxys-A is also fainted. I have Electabuzz and Golem remaining. Electabuzz resists Flying and is neutral to Electric and Ice. Misdreavus as a Ghost-type is immune to my Golem's Earthquake. Misdreavus's full moveset is unknown, but common sets involve Nasty Plot, Pain Split, Shadow Ball, or Thunderbolt. Electabuzz has Thunderbolt and Ice Punch, which might be useful. I need to scout Misdreavus's moveset to determine if it is a setup sweeper or a wall with status. Switching to Electabuzz now opens up an offensive option and reveals more about Misdreavus's strategy.\n\nOpponent has Misdreavus active. My Electabuzz and the opposing Misdreavus are both under Perish Song. I need to switch Electabuzz out this turn to avoid Perish Song KO. Golem is immune to Ghost STAB from Misdreavus and is a good physical attacker. I need to find out Misdreavus's full moveset and item to plan further. Misdreavus often carries Nasty Plot, Pain Split, Shadow Ball, or Thunderbolt. Golem's Earthquake would be useless against Misdreavus, but Rock Slide could be an option if Misdreavus is not immune (it is not). I need to preserve Mantine for potential future threats as it is my only reliable special wall. Remaining Pokémon on opponent's team is now only Misdreavus.\n\nOpponent's Omastar and Medicham have fainted. Misdreavus is an unknown threat with Levitate. My Deoxys-A is also fainted. I have Electabuzz and Golem remaining. Electabuzz resists Flying and is neutral to Electric and Ice. Misdreavus as a Ghost-type is immune to my Golem's Earthquake. Misdreavus's full moveset is unknown, but common sets involve Nasty Plot, Pain Split, Shadow Ball, or Thunderbolt. Electabuzz has Thunderbolt and Ice Punch, which might be useful. I need to scout Misdreavus's moveset to determine if it is a setup sweeper or a wall with status. Switching to Electabuzz now opens up an offensive option and reveals more about Misdreavus's strategy.\nMisdreavus is currently at Perish Song (Perish2), which means it will faint in 2 turns. My Golem is not affected by Perish Song. Golem's Earthquake is immune, but Rock Slide will hit Misdreavus for super effective damage. Misdreavus failed Protect last turn, indicating it is trying to stall. I should use Rock Slide to apply strong offensive pressure and potentially secure the knockout before Perish Song takes effect on Misdreavus. I need to verify if Electabuzz and Mantine are still under Perish Song (they should be at Perish 1). If Misdreavus survives this turn, I will need to reassess how to handle its stall strategy or attacking moves, while also managing the fact that my other Pokémon are under Perish Song. I can use Explosion next turn if Misdreavus is low, or if I need to clear the field for a clean switch-in. Given Golem is Choice Banded, I am locked into Rock Slide. This is okay as it's the optimal offensive move.\n\nOpponent has only Misdreavus remaining. Misdreavus is currently at Perish Song (Perish1), implying it will faint at the end of the next turn. My Golem is Taunted, preventing switches or non-attacking moves. Golem is Choice Banded and used Rock Slide last turn, so it is locked into Rock Slide this turn. Rock Slide is super effective against Misdreavus and should secure the KO given its current HP. If Misdreavus is knocked out, I will have won the game, as the opponent has no other known Pokémon. If it somehow survives, I will need to consider using Explosion next turn if its health is still high enough to warrant the self-KO for a guaranteed win, otherwise, Rock Slide again if it lands within current turn's HP range."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Golem is currently active, and the opponent has just switched in Charizard. Golem is holding a Choice Band, which means it will be locked into the first move it uses. Earthquake is a powerful STAB move that hits Charizard for neutral damage. Given that Charizard is a Flying/Fire type, it resists Rock Slide. Charizard has good special attack and speed, so dealing significant damage quickly is crucial. Using Earthquake immediately applies pressure on Charizard and may force a switch or allow me to secure a KO if Charizard is not physically defensive. I have to avoid using Rock Slide since it is resisted. Hidden Power (type unknown) is generally weaker. Explosion would be a last resort to take Charizard down with me, but it's too early to use it. Therefore, Earthquake is the best immediate offensive option.", "action": "earthquake", "scratchpad": "Opponent's Omastar, Medicham, and Misdreavus have fainted. Charizard is now active at full health. Charizard is a Fire/Flying type with the ability Blaze. Its item is unknown. My Golem is at full HP, holding a Choice Band. Earthquake is a STAB move that hits Charizard for neutral damage. Rock Slide is resisted. I need to observe Charizard's moveset and item to make future strategic decisions. Speed comparison: Golem's speed is 148, Charizard's base speed is 100 which typically means it will be around 250-300+ at level 100 depending on EVs and IVs without nature/item modification. It is likely Charizard outspeeds Golem. My remaining Pokémon are Electabuzz and Mantine. Electabuzz has Thunderbolt, which would be super effective against Charizard, and Mantine resists Fire. My primary goal is to take down Charizard using Golem's physical attacks or set up a sweep with Electabuzz if Golem faints. If Charizard is a special attacker, Golem's special defense is weak, and it could be in trouble. If Charizard is physical, Golem's physical defense is good."}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

 \"switches\": [\n    \"golem\"\n  ]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent's Omastar is out. It is a Water/Rock type. Deoxys-A can outspeed and hit hard with Superpower. Omastar's ability is currently unknown. Need to watch for potential switches and entry hazards.\n\nDeoxys-Attack's Superpower debuffs (-1 Atk, -1 Def) need to be managed. Medicham is at 54% HP and has Pure Power, making it dangerous if allowed to attack. Opponent's Omastar is still an unknown threat with potential entry hazards. Electabuzz and Mantine on my team can be good switch-ins depending on what the opponent brings out next. I should monitor Medicham's item and full moveset if it survives.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is out. It is a Water/Rock type. Medicham was fainted. Deoxys-A has -1 Atk, -1 Def. Omastar's ability is currently unknown, but Swift Swim is common. Its item is also unknown. Need to discover Omastar's moveset, especially if it has entry hazards or set-up moves like Shell Smash. Electabuzz or Mantine could be potential switch-ins later, depending on Omastar's revealed moves. Shadow Ball is chosen to gather more information and avoid further stat drops, while still dealing neutral special damage. If Omastar is a special tank, this may not be optimal, but it is the safest initial play given the current boost situation.\n\nDeoxys-Attack is fainted. Opponent's Omastar is at 74% HP and has Ice Beam as a known move. Omastar's ability is unknown, but Swift Swim is a common threat. Its item is also unknown. I need to scout Omastar's full moveset and ability. Mantine is a good switch here to potentially absorb a Water-type attack. Golem would be hit super critically by any Water or Rock move, and Electabuzz is also a potential good switch in, resisting Water, but Mantine has Water Absorb which could be invaluable if Omastar has a strong Water STAB. Should observe Omastar's next move to determine if it has Rock STAB, set-up, or further coverage. My Golem is Choice Banded and has Earthquake and Rock Slide, which could be useful against other threats later.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is a Water/Rock type with Leftovers. Known move: Ice Beam. Last seen at 80% HP. Its ability is still unknown, but Swift Swim is a significant threat. Mantine is currently out, resisting Ice Beam and potentially absorbing Water-type moves. I need to observe if Omastar has any Rock-type STAB or setup moves like Shell Smash. If Omastar has a powerful Rock-type move like Rock Slide or Ancient Power, Mantine will be in danger. After applying Toxic, I will monitor Omastar's actions. If it appears to be setting up, I can use Haze. If it primarily attacks, Toxic will wear it down. My Golem is a strong physical attacker but is extremely vulnerable to Water/Rock attacks from Omastar. Electabuzz resists Water but is neutral to Rock and Ice. My primary goal now is to put pressure on Omastar and gather more information about its full moveset and ability.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is Water/Rock type, poisoned, and has Leftovers. Known move: Ice Beam. Ability is still unknown (potential Swift Swim, which would mean it outspeeds Mantine). Item is Leftovers. Mantine resists Ice Beam and is immune to Water because of Water Absorb. The primary threat from Omastar is a Rock-type STAB move or Shell Smash. I will continue to attack with Surf to keep the pressure on and wear it down with Toxic. If Omastar attempts to set up with Shell Smash, I can use Haze on the following turn to remove its stat boosts. I need to keep Golem and Electabuzz healthy for the remaining unknown Pokémon on the opponent's team. My Mantine's current health (84.43%) is good, and Leftovers will help sustain it. I will re-evaluate on the next turn based on Omastar's action.\n\nOpponent's Omastar is Water/Rock type, poisoned, and holding Leftovers. Known moves: Ice Beam, Hydro Pump. Ability is still unknown (potential Swift Swim). Mantine resists Ice Beam and is immune to Water via Water Absorb. Omastar's current HP is critically low (31%). Continuing with Surf is the best strategy to eliminate Omastar this turn. Once Omastar is down, I will re-evaluate my team's position versus the opponent's remaining Pokémon and strategize based on what they bring in next. Golem and Electabuzz are still healthy, so I need to preserve them for future threats. I need to be careful of any potential Rock-type STAB from Omastar if it somehow survives, but given its HP and Toxic, it's unlikely.\n\nOpponent's Omastar and Medicham have fainted. Misdreavus is an unknown threat with Levitate. My Deoxys-A is also fainted. I have Electabuzz and Golem remaining. Electabuzz resists Flying and is neutral to Electric and Ice. Misdreavus as a Ghost-type is immune to my Golem's Earthquake. Misdreavus's full moveset is unknown, but common sets involve Nasty Plot, Pain Split, Shadow Ball, or Thunderbolt. Electabuzz has Thunderbolt and Ice Punch, which might be useful. I need to scout Misdreavus's moveset to determine if it is a setup sweeper or a wall with status. Switching to Electabuzz now opens up an offensive option and reveals more about Misdreavus's strategy.\n\nOpponent has Misdreavus active. My Electabuzz and the opposing Misdreavus are both under Perish Song. I need to switch Electabuzz out this turn to avoid Perish Song KO. Golem is immune to Ghost STAB from Misdreavus and is a good physical attacker. I need to find out Misdreavus's full moveset and item to plan further. Misdreavus often carries Nasty Plot, Pain Split, Shadow Ball, or Thunderbolt. Golem's Earthquake would be useless against Misdreavus, but Rock Slide could be an option if Misdreavus is not immune (it is not). I need to preserve Mantine for potential future threats as it is my only reliable special wall. Remaining Pokémon on opponent's team is now only Misdreavus.\n\nOpponent's Omastar and Medicham have fainted. Misdreavus is an unknown threat with Levitate. My Deoxys-A is also fainted. I have Electabuzz and Golem remaining. Electabuzz resists Flying and is neutral to Electric and Ice. Misdreavus as a Ghost-type is immune to my Golem's Earthquake. Misdreavus's full moveset is unknown, but common sets involve Nasty Plot, Pain Split, Shadow Ball, or Thunderbolt. Electabuzz has Thunderbolt and Ice Punch, which might be useful. I need to scout Misdreavus's moveset to determine if it is a setup sweeper or a wall with status. Switching to Electabuzz now opens up an offensive option and reveals more about Misdreavus's strategy.\nMisdreavus is currently at Perish Song (Perish2), which means it will faint in 2 turns. My Golem is not affected by Perish Song. Golem's Earthquake is immune, but Rock Slide will hit Misdreavus for super effective damage. Misdreavus failed Protect last turn, indicating it is trying to stall. I should use Rock Slide to apply strong offensive pressure and potentially secure the knockout before Perish Song takes effect on Misdreavus. I need to verify if Electabuzz and Mantine are still under Perish Song (they should be at Perish 1). If Misdreavus survives this turn, I will need to reassess how to handle its stall strategy or attacking moves, while also managing the fact that my other Pokémon are under Perish Song. I can use Explosion next turn if Misdreavus is low, or if I need to clear the field for a clean switch-in. Given Golem is Choice Banded, I am locked into Rock Slide. This is okay as it's the optimal offensive move.\n\nOpponent has only Misdreavus remaining. Misdreavus is currently at Perish Song (Perish1), implying it will faint at the end of the next turn. My Golem is Taunted, preventing switches or non-attacking moves. Golem is Choice Banded and used Rock Slide last turn, so it is locked into Rock Slide this turn. Rock Slide is super effective against Misdreavus and should secure the KO given its current HP. If Misdreavus is knocked out, I will have won the game, as the opponent has no other known Pokémon. If it somehow survives, I will need to consider using Explosion next turn if its health is still high enough to warrant the self-KO for a guaranteed win, otherwise, Rock Slide again if it lands within current turn's HP range.\n\nOpponent's Omastar, Medicham, and Misdreavus have fainted. Charizard is now active at full health. Charizard is a Fire/Flying type with the ability Blaze. Its item is unknown. My Golem is at full HP, holding a Choice Band. Earthquake is a STAB move that hits Charizard for neutral damage. Rock Slide is resisted. I need to observe Charizard's moveset and item to make future strategic decisions. Speed comparison: Golem's speed is 148, Charizard's base speed is 100 which typically means it will be around 250-300+ at level 100 depending on EVs and IVs without nature/item modification. It is likely Charizard outspeeds Golem. My remaining Pokémon are Electabuzz and Mantine. Electabuzz has Thunderbolt, which would be super effective against Charizard, and Mantine resists Fire. My primary goal is to take down Charizard using Golem's physical attacks or set up a sweep with Electabuzz if Golem faints. If Charizard is a special attacker, Golem's special defense is weak, and it could be in trouble. If Charizard is physical, Golem's physical defense is good.\n\nOpponent has only Charizard remaining. My fainted Pokémon are Deoxys Attack and Electabuzz. My available Pokémon are Golem and Mantine.\n\nCharizard (Fire/Flying, Blaze, unknown item) is at 100% HP. Known move: Earthquake. Speed is likely to be higher than Golem (base 100 vs Golem's base 45).\n\nGolem (Rock/Ground, Sturdy, Choice Band) at 100% HP. Moves: Earthquake, Rock Slide, Hidden Power, Explosion. Immune to Electric, resists Fire, takes neutral from Ground. Weak to Water, Grass, Ice, Fighting.\n\nMantine (Water/Flying, Water Absorb, Leftovers) at 96% HP. Moves: Surf, Ice Beam, Toxic, Haze. Resists Fire, Fighting, Bug. Immune to Ground (Levitate) and Water (Water Absorb). Weak to Electric, Rock.\n\nStrategy for Golem vs. Charizard:\n1. If I switch to Golem, I need to be aware of Charizard's potential special attacks or strong physical attacks. If it carries a Water or Grass move, Golem is in trouble. \n2. My Golem is Choice Banded. If I bring it in, I will have to decide on a move. Earthquake would be the best offensive option against Charizard, hitting it neutrally. Rock Slide would be resisted. Explosion is a last resort to take out Charizard if needed.\n3. Mantine would resist Fire attacks, but Charizard has Earthquake. Mantine is also not very threatening offensively against Charizard beyond a neutral Ice Beam or Surf.\n\nGiven Golem's type matchups (resists Fire, neutral to Ground) and high attack power with Choice Band, it appears to be the better switch-in to try and deal damage immediately, or at least force more information out of Charizard. I will then have to predict if Charizard stays in or switches, and react accordingly.\n\nOpponent has only Charizard remaining. My fainted Pokémon are Deoxys Attack and Electabuzz. My available Pokémon are Golem and Mantine. Charizard (Fire/Flying, Blaze, unknown item) is at 100% HP. Known move: Earthquake. Speed is likely to be higher than Golem (base 100 vs Golem's base 45). Golem (Rock/Ground, Sturdy, Choice Band) at 100% HP. Moves: Earthquake, Rock Slide, Hidden Power, Explosion. Immune to Electric, resists Fire, takes neutral from Ground. Weak to Water, Grass, Ice, Fighting. Mantine (Water/Flying, Water Absorb, Leftovers) at 96% HP. Moves: Surf, Ice Beam, Toxic, Haze. Resists Fire, Fighting, Bug. Immune to Ground (Levitate) and Water (Water Absorb). Weak to Electric, Rock. Golem used Earthquake this turn. I need to monitor the damage output and Charizard's response. If Charizard has a strong special attack, Golem is in trouble. If Charizard switches, I will have a free hit on the next Pokémon or can use Explosion if necessary. The goal is to either weaken Charizard for Mantine to finish off, or take it out with Golem if possible. If Golem gets very low, Explosion will be an option to sacrifice it for a KO.\n\nOpponent's Charizard is currently active and is at 100% health. It is a Fire/Flying type with the ability Blaze. It used Earthquake last turn, indicating it has physical attack coverage. My Golem is locked into Earthquake due to Choice Band. This means Golem will use Earthquake this turn again, which will be ineffective against Charizard. On the next turn, I must switch Golem out. Mantine (Water/Flying, Water Absorb, Leftovers) is my only remaining healthy Pokémon. It resists Charizard's Fire-type attacks and is immune to Ground, but is weak to Rock-type moves if Charizard carries one (like Rock Slide). Mantine can deal neutral damage with Surf or Ice Beam. I need to get Mantine into play to manage this Charizard threat, as Charizard's Earthquake will quickly deal with Golem if it stays in, and Golem cannot hit it with its STAB moves. I will plan to switch Golem out for Mantine on the next turn, hoping Charizard does not have a super-effective Rock-type move for Mantine.\n\nOpponent's Charizard is at 100% HP, Fire/Flying, ability Blaze. Known move: Earthquake. My Golem is almost fainted and locked into an ineffective move. Switching to Mantine is crucial to preserve Golem and bring in a more favorable matchup. Mantine resists Fire and is immune to Ground. Mantine's Water/Ice moves can hit Charizard for neutral damage. I need to observe Charizard's next move after the switch to determine if it has any Rock-type moves that could threaten Mantine."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Golem is severely damaged (26/351 HP) and is locked into Earthquake due to the Choice Band. Charizard is immune to Earthquake due to its Flying type. Keeping Golem in would result in it quickly fainting without dealing any damage. Mantine, on the other hand, is at full health, resists Charizard's Fire-type attacks, and is immune to Ground-type attacks like Earthquake (due to its Flying typing). This makes Mantine an excellent switch-in here. I need to get Mantine into play to manage this Charizard threat, as Charizard's Earthquake will quickly deal with Golem if it stays in, and Golem cannot hit it with its STAB moves. I will switch to Mantine to wall Charizard's physical attacks and potentially deal damage with Surf or Ice Beam.", "action": "mantine", "scratchpad": "Opponent's Charizard is at 51% HP after using Belly Drum, which boosted its Attack by 6 stages. It is a Fire/Flying type with the ability Blaze. It now has incredibly high attack. My Mantine is currently active and at full HP. Mantine resists Fire-type attacks and is immune to Ground-type attacks like Earthquake. However, its Special Attack isn't incredibly high. Charizard's speed is likely higher than Mantine's. The primary concern is if Charizard has a Rock-type move to hit Mantine super effectively, though this is less likely given its current revealed moves (Earthquake, Belly Drum). If Charizard is faster, it will attack first. I should use Haze to reset Charizard's +6 Attack boost next turn, making it less of a threat. If Charizard tries to attack now, it will be with a greatly boosted Earthquake which Mantine is immune to.

]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate. It's likely a support/utility Pokémon, possibly a rapid spinner or user of stat-changing moves. Focusing on immediate damage with Shiftry is good here to prevent it from setting up or supporting. Shiftry is Choice-locked, so I need to make the right initial choice. Gengar, Nidoqueen, and Kyogre are good backups. Kyogre can set up Drizzle, which would weaken Solar Beam and could be useful for other Pokémon. Gengar is frail but fast and has status moves. Nidoqueen is a strong physical attacker. I will monitor Hitmontop's moves to determine its set and role on the opposing team.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate and is almost defeated. Its move High Jump Kick failed, indicating it's not very accurate or just unlucky. Since Shiftry is Choice-locked, I will continue to use offensive moves. After Hitmontop faints, I need to observe what the opponent switches into and adjust my strategy accordingly. I've noted the opponent's Hitmontop appears to be a physical attacker. I still need to determine its full set and role on the opposing team.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is defeated. Snorlax is now active. Snorlax is a Normal-type, so it's immune to Ghost and weak to Fighting. Shiftry is locked into Brick Break (Fighting) from the previous turn, but it's not super effective against Snorlax because Shiftry is Dark and Brick Break is Fighting. It will be resisted. I need to switch. Gengar is a Ghost-type and can hit Snorlax super-effectively. I'll switch to Gengar. I need to watch out for Snorlax's moves; it's a very bulky Pokémon. Kyogre can set up Drizzle to boost its Water moves and potentially help other teammates, but it won't hit Snorlax for super-effective damage. Nidoqueen is a physical attacker like Shiftry and doesn't have a super-effective move against Snorlax. Gengar seems to be the best option here given the type matchup.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is down. Snorlax is active and at full health, tried to use Rest. Snorlax is a Normal type, so Gengar's Ghost-type attacks are ineffective. Taunt is a strong play against Snorlax to prevent recovery or setup. I need to be careful of Snorlax's potential offensive moves if Taunt fails or doesn't apply. I've successfully predicted a defensive play from Snorlax. Once Taunted, I can either chip away with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch or switch. Kyogre could be a good switch later on for offensive pressure or Nidoqueen for physical threats, but Gengar's Taunt is key for now. Snorlax's item is still 'unknown_item', which is important to remember. Its ability is also unknown. Snorlax being male could be relevant if I had Attract or Cute Charm, but not in this case.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is defeated. Snorlax is active. While Snorlax is Taunted, it can't use Rest or other status moves. My Gengar's Thunderbolt is the best offensive option here. I need to observe Snorlax's offensive capabilities if it chooses to attack. If Snorlax proves to be too bulky for Gengar to handle, I might need to consider switching to Kyogre to set up Drizzle and hit it with a powerful Surf, or Nidoqueen for its physical coverage, although neither option has a super-effective move on Snorlax inherently. I'm keeping a close eye on Snorlax's unknown ability and item, as these could influence future turns. For now, chipping with Thunderbolt is the most direct approach given the current conditions.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has fainted. Snorlax was taunted and its Rest failed. Ninetales has Flash Fire and has been paralyzed by Gengar's Thunderbolt. Ninetales is at 76% health. Thunderbolt is proving effective against Ninetales. I will continue to pressure Ninetales with Thunderbolt. If Ninetales faints, I need to reassess the new active Pokémon. My team has Shiftry (Choice Band, fainted), Gengar (Leftovers, active), Nidoqueen (Choice Band), and Kyogre (Leftovers). The opponent's remaining Pokémon are Snorlax (unknown item/ability) and an unknown Pokémon. Gengar is a strong special attacker and has played a key role so far. I will continue to focus on maintaining offensive pressure and using Gengar to chip away at the opponent's team.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate (fainted). Snorlax is the next likely switch-in. Ninetales has Flash Fire and has been paralyzed by Gengar's Thunderbolt. Ninetales is at 24% health. Gengar is a strong special attacker, and Thunderbolt is proving effective. My team consists of Gengar (active), a fainted Shiftry, Nidoqueen, and Kyogre. The opponent's team has a Snorlax (unknown item/ability) and one unknown Pokémon remaining. Given Ninetales' low health and status, targeting it with Thunderbolt again is the optimal move to secure the KO and reduce the opponent's team count. If Gengar needs to switch later, Kyogre or Nidoqueen are good options depending on the next opponent Pokémon. I will continue to track Snorlax's unknown ability and item, as well as the final unknown Pokémon for future turns."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Gengar is currently facing the opponent's Mewtwo. Mewtwo has been hit by Thunderbolt and is at 70% health. My Gengar is currently at 69% health. Mewtwo is a Psychic type, making it weak to Ghost-type attacks. My Gengar has Shadow Ball, which would be super-effective. My Gengar is faster than Mewtwo (308 Speed vs. Mewtwo's unknown speed, but typically Mewtwo's speed is around 130 base, so Gengar should outspeed). Given Mewtwo's lower HP, a super-effective Shadow Ball is the best option to try and take it out. If I switch, Mewtwo could set up or hit one of my other Pokémon for significant damage. Thunderbolt is not very effective against Mewtwo. Ice Punch is not very effective either. Will-O-Wisp could cripple Mewtwo, but a direct attack seems better with Mewtwo's health being at 70%. Taunt would prevent setup, but Mewtwo just switched in, so it's less likely to set up on the first turn unless it's a dedicated setup sweeper. Also, it's possible Mewtwo has powerful coverage that could one-shot Gengar. Taking the offensive route now seems like the highest-reward play.", "action": "shadowball", "scratchpad": "Opponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Snorlax is still in the back (unknown item/ability). Opponent's Ninetales fainted (paralyzed at 24% HP). Opponent's Mewtwo is now active, at 70% health. Mewtwo is a Psychic type. My Gengar is at 69% health. I have Shiftry (fainted), Nidoqueen (Choice Band), and Kyogre (Leftovers). Gengar is faster than Mewtwo and can hit it with a super-effective Ghost-type move. I need to observe Mewtwo's moveset and item to determine its role (e.g., Choice Scarf, Life Orb, Setup Sweeper). If Shadow Ball doesn't one-shot and Mewtwo hits back hard, I might need to consider switching to Nidoqueen or Kyogre to pivot or apply different pressure. Kyogre could be a good switch in if Mewtwo is a special attacker, as Kyogre is very specially bulky. Nidoqueen could revenge kill if Mewtwo is weak to Ground or Poison. For now, the goal is to eliminate Mewtwo quickly before it can establish a strong offensive presence. I've noted that the opponent's Gengar has Willowisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, and Ice Punch. The current Gengar is my team's Gengar. So my Gengar has moves will-o-wisp, taunt, thunderbolt, and icepunch. I need to be careful with the moves and check the available actions carefully. Shadowball is not listed as an available move for my Gengar, so I made a mistake in the previous turn about Gengar's moves. My Gengar actually has Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, and Ice Punch. Since Shadow Ball is not an option, Thunderbolt is the next best available offensive move against Mewtwo, despite not being super effective. Ice Punch is resisted. Will-O-Wisp could be useful to burn Mewtwo, but directly attacking is generally better when trying to secure a KO. Taunt would prevent any setup moves Mewtwo might have, but Mewtwo just switched in so it might want to attack. Given Mewtwo's 70% health, Gengar's Thunderbolt could still chip it down. I need to re-evaluate the next best option given my Gengar's actual moveset. Between Thunderbolt and Willowisp, Thunderbolt will deal immediate chip damage, while Willowisp might be too passive if Mewtwo has high special attack or a healing move. Given that Mewtwo is a strong special attacker, burning it would be beneficial, but it may allow Mewtwo to set up or hit Gengar hard. I will go with Thunderbolt for now to continue chipping away at Mewtwo's health."}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

It's likely a support/utility Pokémon, possibly a rapid spinner or user of stat-changing moves. Focusing on immediate damage with Shiftry is good here to prevent it from setting up or supporting. Shiftry is Choice-locked, so I need to make the right initial choice. Gengar, Nidoqueen, and Kyogre are good backups. Kyogre can set up Drizzle, which would weaken Solar Beam and could be useful for other Pokémon. Gengar is frail but fast and has status moves. Nidoqueen is a strong physical attacker. I will monitor Hitmontop's moves to determine its set and role on the opposing team.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate and is almost defeated. Its move High Jump Kick failed, indicating it's not very accurate or just unlucky. Since Shiftry is Choice-locked, I will continue to use offensive moves. After Hitmontop faints, I need to observe what the opponent switches into and adjust my strategy accordingly. I've noted the opponent's Hitmontop appears to be a physical attacker. I still need to determine its full set and role on the opposing team.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is defeated. Snorlax is now active. Snorlax is a Normal-type, so it's immune to Ghost and weak to Fighting. Shiftry is locked into Brick Break (Fighting) from the previous turn, but it's not super effective against Snorlax because Shiftry is Dark and Brick Break is Fighting. It will be resisted. I need to switch. Gengar is a Ghost-type and can hit Snorlax super-effectively. I'll switch to Gengar. I need to watch out for Snorlax's moves; it's a very bulky Pokémon. Kyogre can set up Drizzle to boost its Water moves and potentially help other teammates, but it won't hit Snorlax for super-effective damage. Nidoqueen is a physical attacker like Shiftry and doesn't have a super-effective move against Snorlax. Gengar seems to be the best option here given the type matchup.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is down. Snorlax is active and at full health, tried to use Rest. Snorlax is a Normal type, so Gengar's Ghost-type attacks are ineffective. Taunt is a strong play against Snorlax to prevent recovery or setup. I need to be careful of Snorlax's potential offensive moves if Taunt fails or doesn't apply. I've successfully predicted a defensive play from Snorlax. Once Taunted, I can either chip away with Thunderbolt/Ice Punch or switch. Kyogre could be a good switch later on for offensive pressure or Nidoqueen for physical threats, but Gengar's Taunt is key for now. Snorlax's item is still 'unknown_item', which is important to remember. Its ability is also unknown. Snorlax being male could be relevant if I had Attract or Cute Charm, but not in this case.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop is defeated. Snorlax is active. While Snorlax is Taunted, it can't use Rest or other status moves. My Gengar's Thunderbolt is the best offensive option here. I need to observe Snorlax's offensive capabilities if it chooses to attack. If Snorlax proves to be too bulky for Gengar to handle, I might need to consider switching to Kyogre to set up Drizzle and hit it with a powerful Surf, or Nidoqueen for its physical coverage, although neither option has a super-effective move on Snorlax inherently. I'm keeping a close eye on Snorlax's unknown ability and item, as these could influence future turns. For now, chipping with Thunderbolt is the most direct approach given the current conditions.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has fainted. Snorlax was taunted and its Rest failed. Ninetales has Flash Fire and has been paralyzed by Gengar's Thunderbolt. Ninetales is at 76% health. Thunderbolt is proving effective against Ninetales. I will continue to pressure Ninetales with Thunderbolt. If Ninetales faints, I need to reassess the new active Pokémon. My team has Shiftry (Choice Band, fainted), Gengar (Leftovers, active), Nidoqueen (Choice Band), and Kyogre (Leftovers). The opponent's remaining Pokémon are Snorlax (unknown item/ability) and an unknown Pokémon. Gengar is a strong special attacker and has played a key role so far. I will continue to focus on maintaining offensive pressure and using Gengar to chip away at the opponent's team.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop has Intimidate (fainted). Snorlax is the next likely switch-in. Ninetales has Flash Fire and has been paralyzed by Gengar's Thunderbolt. Ninetales is at 24% health. Gengar is a strong special attacker, and Thunderbolt is proving effective. My team consists of Gengar (active), a fainted Shiftry, Nidoqueen, and Kyogre. The opponent's team has a Snorlax (unknown item/ability) and one unknown Pokémon remaining. Given Ninetales' low health and status, targeting it with Thunderbolt again is the optimal move to secure the KO and reduce the opponent's team count. If Gengar needs to switch later, Kyogre or Nidoqueen are good options depending on the next opponent Pokémon. I will continue to track Snorlax's unknown ability and item, as well as the final unknown Pokémon for future turns.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Snorlax is still in the back (unknown item/ability). Opponent's Ninetales fainted (paralyzed at 24% HP). Opponent's Mewtwo is now active, at 70% health. Mewtwo is a Psychic type. My Gengar is at 69% health. I have Shiftry (fainted), Nidoqueen (Choice Band), and Kyogre (Leftovers). Gengar is faster than Mewtwo and can hit it with a super-effective Ghost-type move. I need to observe Mewtwo's moveset and item to determine its role (e.g., Choice Scarf, Life Orb, Setup Sweeper). If Shadow Ball doesn't one-shot and Mewtwo hits back hard, I might need to consider switching to Nidoqueen or Kyogre to pivot or apply different pressure. Kyogre could be a good switch in if Mewtwo is a special attacker, as Kyogre is very specially bulky. Nidoqueen could revenge kill if Mewtwo is weak to Ground or Poison. For now, the goal is to eliminate Mewtwo quickly before it can establish a strong offensive presence. I've noted that the opponent's Gengar has Willowisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, and Ice Punch. The current Gengar is my team's Gengar. So my Gengar has moves will-o-wisp, taunt, thunderbolt, and icepunch. I need to be careful with the moves and check the available actions carefully. Shadowball is not listed as an available move for my Gengar, so I made a mistake in the previous turn about Gengar's moves. My Gengar actually has Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, and Ice Punch. Since Shadow Ball is not an option, Thunderbolt is the next best available offensive move against Mewtwo, despite not being super effective. Ice Punch is resisted. Will-O-Wisp could be useful to burn Mewtwo, but directly attacking is generally better when trying to secure a KO. Taunt would prevent any setup moves Mewtwo might have, but Mewtwo just switched in so it might want to attack. Given Mewtwo's 70% health, Gengar's Thunderbolt could still chip it down. I need to re-evaluate the next best option given my Gengar's actual moveset. Between Thunderbolt and Willowisp, Thunderbolt will deal immediate chip damage, while Willowisp might be too passive if Mewtwo has high special attack or a healing move. Given that Mewtwo is a strong special attacker, burning it would be beneficial, but it may allow Mewtwo to set up or hit Gengar hard. I will go with Thunderbolt for now to continue chipping away at Mewtwo's health.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Ninetales (Flash Fire, paralyzed) fainted. Opponent's Mewtwo (70% HP) is still in the back. Opponent's Snorlax (unknown item/ability) is currently active. My Nidoqueen is now active. I've used Superpower against Snorlax, which should deal significant damage due to type advantage and Choice Band. I need to observe the damage output and Snorlax's response. After this move, Nidoqueen's Attack and Defense will drop, which might necessitate a switch unless Snorlax is defeated or seriously weakened. I need to keep in mind the remaining Pokémon on both sides and look for opportunities to pivot or set up for the win condition. Kyogre might be a good switch if Snorlax proves too difficult for Nidoqueen to take down in one hit or if Nidoqueen's lowered stats become a liability. Gengar is also an option, but its damage output is not as high as Nidoqueen's Superpower against Snorlax. I also need to keep track of Mewtwo and its potential threat. I need to confirm Snorlax's exact moveset as it has only used Rest so far.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Ninetales (Flash Fire, paralyzed) fainted. Opponent's Mewtwo is still in the back at 70% health. Opponent's Snorlax is currently active, now at 30% HP. My Nidoqueen is at 64% health. Last turn, Nidoqueen used Superpower on Snorlax, dealing significant damage. Snorlax responded with Shadow Ball. Nidoqueen's stats are now lowered. Since Nidoqueen is Choice-locked into Superpower, I will use it again. If Snorlax faints, I need to prepare for Mewtwo, which is a significant threat. If Snorlax survives, Nidoqueen will be very weakened, and I'll likely need to switch to Kyogre or Gengar to prevent Nidoqueen from being knocked out. I need to track Mewtwo's moveset and potential item (e.g., Choice Scarf, Life Orb, Setup Sweeper) for later in the battle. Kyogre's Drizzle might be helpful against Mewtwo, especially if it's a physical variant, or if I anticipate a switch to a mon weak to water.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Ninetales (Flash Fire, paralyzed) fainted. Opponent's Mewtwo is still in the back at 70% health. Opponent's Snorlax (unknown item/ability) is currently active. My Nidoqueen is at 64% health. Last turn, Nidoqueen used Superpower on Snorlax, dealing significant damage. Snorlax responded with Shadow Ball. Nidoqueen's stats are now lowered. Since Nidoqueen is Choice-locked into Superpower, I will use it again. If Snorlax faints, I need to prepare for Mewtwo, which is a significant threat. If Snorlax survives, Nidoqueen will be very weakened, and I'll likely need to switch to Kyogre or Gengar to prevent Nidoqueen from being knocked out. I need to track Mewtwo's moveset and potential item (e.g., Choice Scarf, Life Orb, Setup Sweeper) for later in the battle. Kyogre's Drizzle might be helpful against Mewtwo, especially if it's a physical variant, or if I anticipate a switch to a mon weak to water. My current Nidoqueen is active, but its attack and defense are lowered. The opponent has Ninetales at 30% HP and paralyzed. Switching to Gengar seems like the best play to finish off Ninetales and reset Nidoqueen's stats.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted already. Opponent's Snorlax (unknown item/ability) is still in the back at unknown health, and Mewtwo is also in the back at 70% health. Nidoqueen has lowered stats and is currently in the back if Ninetales does not go down. My Gengar is at 26% health. Kyogre is at full health. Shiftry has fainted. Once Ninetales is dealt with, I need to predict whether the opponent sends out Snorlax or Mewtwo. Mewtwo is a huge threat, and Snorlax can be very tanky. I need to keep this in mind. Nidoqueen's stats being lowered is a factor for future plays. My Gengar is at low health, so if Thunderbolt doesn't do enough, Gengar will likely be taken out next turn and I'll need to send in a fresh Pokémon like Kyogre to handle Mewtwo or clean up Snorlax. Assuming Thunderbolt KOs, I then need to prepare for Snorlax or Mewtwo. If Snorlax comes out, Kyogre with Surf or Nidoqueen with Superpower (if stats reset) would be good. If Mewtwo comes out, Kyogre's bulk might be useful, or a faster hit with Nidoqueen or a powered-up Nidoqueen. I've noted that the opponent's Gengar has Willowisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, and Ice Punch. The current Gengar is my team's Gengar. So my Gengar has moves will-o-wisp, taunt, thunderbolt, and icepunch. Given the situation, Thunderbolt is the optimal choice.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Ninetales (Flash Fire, paralyzed) fainted. Opponent's Snorlax (unknown item/ability) is still in the back. Currently facing Mewtwo, which is at low health (41%). My Gengar is also at low health (32%), but is faster and has a super-effective Thunderbolt. This turn is critical to try and take out Mewtwo. If Gengar goes down, I have Nidoqueen (Choice Band) and Kyogre (Leftovers) remaining. Kyogre's Drizzle and high special bulk would be useful for cleanup or for dealing with Snorlax. Nidoqueen could be a good revenge killer if Mewtwo survives and is weakened enough, or if Snorlax comes in next. I need to keep a close eye on Mewtwo's actual moveset and item, which are still unknown to me. If Mewtwo has a boosting move like Calm Mind, I need to prevent it from setting up too much. For now, securing the KO on Mewtwo is the priority.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Ninetales (Flash Fire, paralyzed) fainted. Opponent's Snorlax (unknown item/ability) is still in the back at unknown health. Opponent's Mewtwo is at 41% HP. My Gengar has fainted. I have Nidoqueen (64% HP, stats lowered from Superpower) and Kyogre (100% HP) remaining. I've switched to Kyogre to leverage its special bulk against Mewtwo and potentially set up Drizzle. I need to observe Mewtwo's next move and item. If Mewtwo is a special attacker, Kyogre is well-positioned. If Mewtwo has a physical move, Kyogre's high HP can still help. I will consider using Calm Mind with Kyogre to boost my Special Attack and Special Defense, or directly attack with Surf or Thunder depending on the situation and Mewtwo's moves. I need to be mindful of Snorlax in the back and how to deal with it after Mewtwo is gone, or if they decide to switch.\n\nOpponent's Hitmontop (Intimidate) fainted. Opponent's Ninetales (Flash Fire, paralyzed) fainted. Opponent's Snorlax (unknown item/ability) is still in the back at unknown health. The opposing Mewtwo is at 41% health. My Gengar has fainted. I have Nidoqueen (64% HP, stats lowered from Superpower) and Kyogre (100% HP) remaining. Kyogre is now active and Drizzle has set up Rain Dance. This makes Thunder a 100% accurate, super-effective move and boosts Surf. The priority is to eliminate Mewtwo using Thunder.

turn):\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate. My Shiftry got its attack lowered. Hitmontop is a defensive pivot. My Shiftry has Choice Band. Switching to Gengar to resist hits and apply pressure. Gengar's known moves are Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, Ice Punch. This covers various threats and can status/chip down walls.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate.

This is a safe play as Gengar is immune to Hitmontop's primary STAB type and any Ground-type attacks it might carry. Hitmontop's Rock Slide missed. Turn 3: Hitmontop is burned and its offensive presence is limited. Gengar remains at full health. Ice Punch provides super-effective damage against Hitmontop and will continue to chip away at its HP, eventually wearing it down due to burn and direct damage. I should keep an eye on what Pokémon the opponent switches into.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate. My Shiftry got its attack lowered. Hitmontop is a defensive pivot.

Turn 3: Hitmontop is burned and its offensive presence is limited. Gengar remains healthy. Ice Punch provides super-effective damage against Hitmontop and chipped away at its HP. Turn 4: Hitmontop is at low HP (59%) and still burned. Will use Ice Punch again to aim for the knockout. Gengar's current HP is 71.52% which is good. My Kyogre, Nidoqueen, and Shiftry are still healthy in the back.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate. My Shiftry got its attack lowered. Hitmontop is a defensive pivot.

Turn 4: Hitmontop is at low HP (59%) and still burned. The opponent switched to Snorlax. Snorlax is likely a special wall with access to moves like Curse or RestTalk. Gengar's Thunderbolt will be super effective and deal good damage. I need to keep track of Snorlax's moveset and if it uses a boosting move or recovery. My Kyogre and Nidoqueen are good options in the back for later in the game.\n\nOpponent's Snorlax has Rest, making it a potential setup or stall threat. I need to continue to chip away at Snorlax's health while it is asleep. Gengar's Thunderbolt seems to be the best option to do this, as it is a strong special attack. I will continue to track Snorlax's health and the number of turns it has been asleep.\n\nOpponent's Snorlax has Rest, making it a potential setup or stall threat.

I will continue to track Snorlax's health and the number of turns it has been asleep. Opponent switched to Ninetales. Ninetales has Flash Fire, which is not relevant against Gengar. Thunderbolt remains the best move to apply pressure. I need to observe Ninetales's moves and potential role on the opponent's team. It could be a support or offensive Pokémon. Gengar still has good health.\n\nOpponent's Ninetales is at 55% health. Thunderbolt is Gengar's strongest special attacking move against Ninetales. Ninetales has Flash Fire, which isn't relevant to Gengar's moveset. Ninetales missed its Fire Blast last turn. Continue applying pressure with Thunderbolt and observe if Ninetales switches or attempts another attack. If Ninetales stays, it should be defeated by another Thunderbolt. Keep track of Ninetales confirmed moves and potential other threats it might carry. It seems to be a special attacker or a mixed attacker with Fire Blast.\n\nOpponent's Ninetales is at 31% HP. It used Grudge, so my Thunderbolt will have its PP depleted if it connects. However, Gengar outspeeds Ninetales and a Thunderbolt should secure the KO. I have enough PP to take this risk. If Ninetales somehow survives or switches, I need to reassess. I still have Shiftry, Nidoqueen, and Kyogre in the back, all at full health. Kyogre is a strong special attacker and Nidoqueen is a good physical attacker. Shadow Ball from Shiftry could also be useful against Gengar later. I need to keep in mind that the opponent still has Hitmontop (burned) and Snorlax (asleep) as potential switch-ins.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate. My Shiftry got its attack lowered. Hitmontop is a defensive pivot. My Shiftry has Choice Band. Switching to Gengar to resist hits and apply pressure.

My Kyogre and Nidoqueen are good options in the back for later in the game. Turn 5: Snorlax used Rest. It is now asleep and will recover health. Gengar used Thunderbolt, dealing good damage. Now Snorlax is at full health but asleep. This could be a good opportunity to set up or switch. Turn 6: Opponent switched to Ninetales. Ninetales took damage from Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt remains the best move to apply pressure. I need to observe Ninetales's moves and potential role on the opponent's team. It could be a support or offensive Pokémon. Gengar still has good health. Turn 7: Gengar used Thunderbolt, dealing more damage to Ninetales. Ninetales missed Fire Blast. Thunderbolt is Gengar's strongest special attacking move against Ninetales. Ninetales has Flash Fire, which isn't relevant for Gengar. Turn 8: Gengar used Thunderbolt, damaging Ninetales. Ninetales used Grudge, so if Gengar used Thunderbolt again, its PP would be emptied. Turn 9: Gengar used Thunderbolt, knocking out Ninetales, and Thunderbolt's PP was emptied. Snorlax was switched in, now asleep and at full health. Kyogre should be switched in to absorb hits and apply pressure.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate.

Snorlax was switched in, now asleep and at full health. Kyogre was switched in to absorb hits and apply pressure. Turn 10: Kyogre's Drizzle activated Rain Dance. Mewtwo is now active. Kyogre's Surf will be boosted by rain and target Mewtwo's weaker Special Defense. I will go for Surf to deal immediate damage and test Mewtwo's item and move set. Subsequent turns will depend on Mewtwo's response.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate. My Shiftry got its attack lowered. Hitmontop is a defensive pivot.

Kyogre's Surf will be boosted by rain and target Mewtwo's weaker Special Defense. I will go for Surf to deal immediate damage and test Mewtwo's item and move set. Turn 11: Kyogre's Thunder hit Mewtwo, landing a super-effective hit and paralyzing Mewtwo. Mewtwo's Surf dealt significant damage to Kyogre, bringing it down to 43.56%. Mewtwo is at 2% HP. Given Kyogre's paralysis and low HP, switching to a healthy Gengar to finish off Mewtwo is the safest play, as Gengar is immune to Psychic.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate.

Turn 3: Hitmontop is burned and its offensive presence is limited. Gengar remains healthy. Ice Punch provided super-effective damage against Hitmontop and chipped away at its HP. Turn 4: Hitmontop is at low HP (59%) and still burned. The opponent switched to Snorlax. Snorlax is likely a special wall with access to moves like Curse or RestTalk. Gengar's Thunderbolt will be super effective and deal good damage. I need to keep track of Snorlax's moveset and if it uses a boosting move or recovery. My Kyogre and Nidoqueen are good options in the back for later in the game. Turn 5: Snorlax used Rest. It is now asleep and will recover health. Gengar used Thunderbolt, dealing good damage. Now Snorlax is at full health but asleep. This could be a good opportunity to set up or switch. Turn 6: Opponent switched to Ninetales. Ninetales took damage from Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt remains the best move to apply pressure. I need to observe Ninetales's moves and potential role on the opponent's team. It could be a support or offensive Pokémon. Gengar still has good health. Turn 7: Gengar used Thunderbolt, dealing more damage to Ninetales. Ninetales missed Fire Blast. Thunderbolt is Gengar's strongest special attacking move against Ninetales. Ninetales has Flash Fire, which isn't relevant for Gengar. Turn 8: Gengar used Thunderbolt, damaging Ninetales. Ninetales used Grudge, so if Gengar used Thunderbolt again, its PP would be emptied. Turn 9: Gengar used Thunderbolt, knocking out Ninetales, and Thunderbolt's PP was emptied. Snorlax was switched in, now asleep and at full health. Kyogre was switched in to absorb hits and apply pressure. Turn 10: Kyogre's Drizzle activated Rain Dance. Mewtwo is now active. Kyogre's Surf will be boosted by rain and target Mewtwo's weaker Special Defense. I will go for Surf to deal immediate damage and test Mewtwo's item and move set. Turn 11: Kyogre's Thunder hit Mewtwo, landing a super-effective hit and paralyzing Mewtwo. Mewtwo's Surf dealt significant damage to Kyogre, bringing it down to 43.56%. Mewtwo is at 2% HP. Given Kyogre's paralysis and low HP, switching to a healthy Gengar to finish off Mewtwo was the safest play, as Gengar is immune to Psychic. Turn 12: Gengar used Ice Beam on Mewtwo, dealing significant damage. Mewtwo remains at very low HP. My Gengar has Ice Punch, not Ice Beam (correction to previous scratchpad, Gengar's moves are Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, Ice Punch). The previous log implies Mewtwo used Ice Beam, which my Gengar absorbed well, confirming Gengar's resistance to Ice. With Mewtwo at 2% HP, Gengar should be able to finish it off with Ice Punch.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate. My Shiftry got its attack lowered.

Gengar used Ice Punch on Mewtwo, dealing significant damage. Mewtwo is very low HP. Turn 13: Gengar used Ice Punch, knocking out Mewtwo. The opponent switched to Hitmontop, which has Intimidate, lowering Gengar's attack. Hitmontop is burned and took residual damage. It's at 53% HP. Gengar is at around 67% HP. The opponent has Snorlax (asleep) and Kyogre (paralyzed with 43.56% HP) in the back. I should use Ice Punch to finish off Hitmontop.\n\nTurn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate.

The opponent has Snorlax (asleep) and Kyogre (paralyzed with 43.56% HP) in the back. Turn 14: Gengar used Ice Punch on Hitmontop, but the log stated immune. Hitmontop used High Jump Kick and missed, likely because Gengar is a Ghost type. Hitmontop is at 21% HP and still burned. I will try Ice Punch again, as the previous 'immune' entry regarding ice was likely incorrect or a logging error. If it confirms immunity I will switch to Nidoqueen who has Earthquake next turn. Turn 15: Hitmontop was knocked out by Gengar's Ice Punch. Snorlax was switched in, still asleep at 100% health, but now at 96% after Gengar's Ice Punch. Thunderbolt's PP is already depleted. Ice Punch is the only offensive move Gengar has left. I will use Ice Punch to damage Snorlax while it is asleep. This gives me a free hit. The opponent has a sleeping Snorlax and a paralyzed Kyogre (43.56% HP). My Gengar is at 85.76% and -1 Atk. I also have a full health Shiftry and Nidoqueen, and a less than half health paralyzed Kyogre. Turn 16-17: Gengar used Ice Punch on Snorlax while it was asleep. Snorlax woke up at Turn 18. Turn 18: Snorlax used Shadow Ball on Gengar, dealing significant damage and knocking Gengar out. My Gengar has fainted. I need to switch in a new Pokémon. Opponent has a Snorlax at 75% health. Considering Nidoqueen next due to Ghost resistance and Earthquake super effectiveness."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Gengar just fainted to Snorlax's Shadow Ball. I need to switch in a new Pokémon. Nidoqueen is a good choice because it resists Ghost-type attacks from Snorlax (as a Ground/Poison type, Ghost is resisted). Additionally, Nidoqueen has Earthquake, which is super effective against Snorlax (Normal type). Snorlax is currently at 75% health, and Nidoqueen is at full health and holds a Choice Band, which will boost its attack significantly. This allows Nidoqueen to come in, take a hit if necessary, and potentially deal a lot of damage with Earthquake.", "action": "nidoqueen", "scratchpad": "Turn 1: Opponent led with Hitmontop, which has Intimidate. My Shiftry got its attack lowered. Hitmontop is a defensive pivot. My Shiftry has Choice Band. Switching to Gengar to resist hits and apply pressure. Gengar's known moves are Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Thunderbolt, Ice Punch. Gengar is immune to Hitmontop's High Jump Kick. Turn 2: Burn Hitmontop with Will-O-Wisp to reduce its attack and apply chip damage. This is a safe play as Gengar is immune to Hitmontop's primary STAB type and any Ground-type attacks it might carry. Hitmontop's Rock Slide missed. Turn 3: Hitmontop is burned and its offensive presence is limited. Gengar remains healthy. Ice Punch provided super-effective damage against Hitmontop and chipped away at its HP. Turn 4: Hitmontop is at low HP (59%) and still burned. The opponent switched to Snorlax. Snorlax is likely a special wall with access to moves like Curse or RestTalk. Gengar's Thunderbolt will be super effective and deal good damage. I need to keep track of Snorlax's moveset and if it uses a boosting move or recovery. My Kyogre and Nidoqueen are good options in the back for later in the game. Turn 5: Snorlax used Rest. It is now asleep and will recover health. Gengar used Thunderbolt, dealing good damage. Now Snorlax is at full health but asleep. This could be a good opportunity to set up or switch. Turn 6: Opponent switched to Ninetales. Ninetales took damage from Thunderbolt. Thunderbolt remains the best move to apply pressure. I need to observe Ninetales's moves and potential role on the opponent's team. It could be a support or offensive Pokémon. Gengar still has good health. Turn 7: Gengar used Thunderbolt, dealing more damage to Ninetales. Ninetales missed Fire Blast. Thunderbolt is Gengar's strongest special attacking move against Ninetales. Ninetales has Flash Fire, which isn't relevant for Gengar. Turn 8: Gengar used Thunderbolt, damaging Ninetales. Ninetales used Grudge, so if Gengar used Thunderbolt again, its PP would be emptied. Turn 9: Gengar used Thunderbolt, knocking out Ninetales, and Thunderbolt's PP was emptied. Snorlax was switched in, now asleep and at full health. Kyogre was switched in to absorb hits and apply pressure. Turn 10: Kyogre's Drizzle activated Rain Dance. Mewtwo is now active. Kyogre's Surf will be boosted by rain and target Mewtwo's weaker Special Defense. I will go for Surf to deal immediate damage and test Mewtwo's item and move set. Turn 11: Kyogre's Thunder hit Mewtwo, landing a super-effective hit and paralyzing Mewtwo. Mewtwo's Surf dealt significant damage to Kyogre, bringing it down to 43.56%. Mewtwo is at 2% HP. Given Kyogre's paralysis and low HP, switching to a healthy Gengar to finish off Mewtwo was the safest play, as Gengar is immune to Psychic. Turn 12: Gengar was switched in and Mewtwo used Calm Mind. Gengar used Ice Punch on Mewtwo, dealing significant damage. Mewtwo is very low HP. Turn 13: Gengar used Ice Punch, knocking out Mewtwo. The opponent switched to Hitmontop, which has Intimidate, lowering Gengar's attack. Hitmontop is burned and took residual damage. It's at 53% HP. Gengar is at around 67% HP. The opponent has Snorlax (asleep) and Kyogre (paralyzed with 43.56% HP) in the back. Turn 14: Gengar used Ice Punch on Hitmontop, but the log stated immune. Hitmontop used High Jump Kick and missed, likely because Gengar is a Ghost type. Hitmontop is at 21% HP and still burned.

Turn 18: Snorlax used Shadow Ball on Gengar, dealing significant damage and knocking Gengar out. My Gengar has fainted. I need to switch in a new Pokémon. Opponent has a Snorlax at 75% health. Considering Nidoqueen next due to Ghost resistance and Earthquake super effectiveness. Kyogre is paralyzed and at low health, while Shiftry is a physical attacker that might not do as well against Snorlax initially, and has a less favorable typing.

Known moves for Gengar could be Thunderbolt, Ice Punch, Psychic, Will-O-Wisp, Counter. Gyarados has Earthquake, Hidden Power (Dark), Double-Edge, and Dragon Dance. Earthquake is negated by Levitate. Hidden Power (Dark) is not very effective. Double-Edge is neutral but Gengar will outspeed and deal significant damage. Dragon Dance sets up Gyarados. Given the intimidate, I will use Dragon Dance. If Gengar switches, I gain a free setup. If Gengar attacks, I can assess the damage and potentially outspeed and hit hard next turn. My team has Kyogre, Mantine, and Swampert. Kyogre is weak to Gengar's Thunderbolt. Mantine is also weak to Electric, but neutral to Ghost. Swampert resists Electric but is neutral to Ghost. Gengar outspeeds at base. After a Dragon Dance, Gyarados's Speed would be boosted. I am predicting that Gengar will attack offensively, so a Dragon Dance will allow me to outspeed and hit hard. It is a risk, but it's the optimal play, as my other pokemon does not resist gengar's attacks so i would not want to switch.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, which means I've lost an intimidate user and a potential physical sweeper. The opponent's Gengar is out. I've switched in Kyogre which brings Drizzle. Kyogre can threaten Gengar with STAB Surf, and Thunder under Drizzle will have 100% accuracy. I need to observe if Gengar stays in or switches out. If Gengar stays in, I will use Surf next turn. If Gengar switches, I'll assess the new threat and plan accordingly. I will note that Gengar's known move is Thunderbolt, making my Mantine a less desirable switch-in against it if I had wanted to preserve Kyogre.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, but Kyogre is in and has set up Rain. Gengar's known move is Thunderbolt. Kyogre has STAB Surf and 100% accurate Thunder under Rain, both super effective on Gengar. Kyogre's Special Attack is very high. I need to keep in mind Gengar's potential coverage moves (e.g., Psychic, Ice Punch) for my other Pokémon. My Mantine is weak to Electric, and Swampert, while resisting Electric, is neutral to Ghost. I will try to take down Gengar with Kyogre before it causes more damage. Kyogre's Leftovers recovery is also helpful. Next turns, I'll monitor for opponent's switches and potential Gengar moves to update my strategy.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, but Kyogre is in and has set up Rain. Gengar's known move is Thunderbolt, but it's now at very low HP. Kyogre has STAB Surf and 100% accurate Thunder under Rain, both super effective on Gengar. Kyogre's Special Attack is very high. I need to keep in mind Gengar's potential coverage moves (e.g., Psychic, Ice Punch) for my other Pokémon. My Mantine is weak to Electric, and Swampert, while resisting Electric, is neutral to Ghost. I will try to take down Gengar with Kyogre before it causes more damage. Kyogre's Leftovers recovery is also helpful. Now that Gengar is nearly fainted, Surf should finish it off. After Gengar is defeated, I will reassess the opponent's next Pokémon and adjust my strategy, considering my remaining team members Mantine and Swampert.\n\nOpponent's Gengar fainted, Heracross fainted. Kecleon is now active. Its ability is Color Change. Kyogre has Leftovers for recovery. Knowing Kecleon's ability means I should vary my attacks or boost before attacking if I want to maintain super-effective hits. Calm Mind is a good play to set up offensive and defensive stats. Next turn I will assess if Kecleon is a special or physical attacker and what its moves are. If Kecleon sets up or has a move like Toxic, I might be in trouble. I still have Mantine and Swampert in the back. Mantine can Haze if opponent sets up. Swampert provides Earthquake if needed. Kyogre is currently healthy, so boosting now is a good idea to prepare for future threats.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, and now Heracross and Gengar have also fainted from the opponent's side. The opponent's active Pokemon is Kecleon. It has Color Change, which means its type will change to the type of the last move that hit it. This makes it tricky to always hit with super effective moves. Kyogre is at very low health (56 HP out of 404), even after one Calm Mind boost. Kecleon hit with Return last turn, doing significant damage. Switching out Kyogre is a priority to protect it. Mantine, at full health, is a good switch-in here. It resists Normal and can hit back with Surf or Ice Beam. Swampert is also an option, but its Earthquake would make Kecleon a Ground type, which could then potentially set up to hit Swampert with a Grass or Ice move if it has coverage. Mantine is safer as it can take hits better due to its higher Special Defense and Flying typing against potential Ground moves. I need to keep track of Kecleon's revealed moves and assess if it has any status moves (e.g., Toxic, Thunder Wave) or setup moves. My win condition is to chip down Kecleon and then bring Kyogre back if needed for a sweep. Mantine also has Haze, which can be useful if Kecleon tries to set up. I'll use Mantine to wall Kecleon and try to get some damage in.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine is currently active and at low HP (19.46% after taking a Return). Switching Mantine out to Swampert is the optimal move to prevent Mantine from fainting and get a healthier Pokémon on the field. Swampert can take hits better due to its higher HP and Defense. Swampert's Earthquake will be effective against Kecleon, but I need to be careful of Color Change. If Kecleon becomes a Ground type, it might have moves that are super effective against Water/Ground types (like Grass or Ice). I need to observe Kecleon's moveset carefully, especially for status moves like Toxic or setup moves. My current win condition is to chip down Kecleon, preserve Kyogre, and exploit type matchups with Swampert and Mantine. Mantine still has Haze if needed against setup. I will evaluate Kecleon's next move against Swampert to better understand its capabilities.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine also took damage and is low. Swampert is currently active and took a hit from Kecleon's Return, but is still reasonably healthy at 56.33%. Kecleon is at 100% HP. Swampert's `Protect` is a tactical move to scout Kecleon's next play. If Kecleon attacks, I will learn its move and can better plan my next turn to either attack with Earthquake or switch if Kecleon has a super-effective move. After `Protect`, I will be better informed to decide whether to use Earthquake or switch out to Kyogre (who is very low) or Mantine (who is also low, but still has Haze if needed). The priority is to chip down Kecleon and preserve my other Pokémon for later, especially Kyogre for a potential late-game sweep. I will continue to track Kecleon's revealed moves and assess its type in relation to its attacks. Win condition relies on Kyogre sweeping or out-damaging Kecleon with Swampert and Mantine's combined efforts.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine also took damage and is low. Swampert is currently active and took a hit from Kecleon's Return. Swampert used Protect successfully last turn, confirming Kecleon's 'Return' move and its physical attacking nature. Swampert's Earthquake is a strong STAB option. If Kecleon switches, I will have dealt chip damage or forced a switch. If Kecleon stays in, Earthquake should deal substantial neutral damage. I still need to be aware of possible status moves (e.g., Toxic, Thunder Wave) or setup moves from Kecleon, as well as any unexpected coverage moves. My win condition relies on preserving Kyogre for a late-game sweep, and Swampert pushing damage now on Kecleon. I'll continue to monitor Kecleon's health and potential switches. Kecleon currently doesn't seem to pose an immediate super-effective threat to Swampert, but I'll update my assessment if further moves are revealed.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine also took damage and is low. Swampert is currently active and took a hit from Kecleon's Return. Swampert used Protect successfully last turn, confirming Kecleon's 'Return' move and its physical attacking nature. Swampert hit Kecleon with Earthquake, turning Kecleon into a Ground type. Kecleon then used Return again, bringing Swampert to 37% HP. Kecleon is at 44% HP. Now that Kecleon is a Ground type, Hydro Pump will be super effective. This is a crucial turn to try and knock out Kecleon to preserve Swampert and my other low-HP Pokémon. I need to be mindful of its last revealed move, Return, which is a physical attack. Therefore, a special attack like Hydro Pump is the best choice to take advantage of the type change. If Kecleon survives, I will need to reassess based on its next move and the damage done. My win condition relies on preserving Kyogre for a late-game sweep and having Swampert remove Kecleon now.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. The opponent's active Pokemon is now Gyarados. It has Intimidate which lowered Swampert's attack. Gyarados revealed it holds Leftovers. Swampert's Hydro Pump was resisted. Swampert is at 43.42% HP. Kyogre is at 13.86% HP and Mantine is at 19.46% HP. Given Gyarados's Intimidate and type resistance to Water, I need to be careful. Gyarados likely has Dragon Dance, making it a dangerous setup sweeper. Mantine has Haze which can nullify Gyarados's boosts. Switching to Mantine seems like the best play to scout the opponent's next move and potentially counter a Dragon Dance setup. I need to observe Gyarados's moveset, especially for any Electric or Rock-type coverage that would hit Mantine super effectively. If Gyarados sets up, Haze can be crucial. If it attacks, hopefully Mantine can take a hit and retaliate with Ice Beam or Surf, or toxic to whittle it down, or haze to prevent it from boosting. My goal is to prevent Gyarados from sweeping and preserve Kyogre for a late-game sweep if possible.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has revealed Dragon Dance and Leftovers. It has Intimidate. So far, its known moves include Dragon Dance. Swampert was hit by Gyarados's Hydro Pump, which was resisted. Gyarados is boosted in Attack and Speed. Mantine is at low HP (25.45%). My Kyogre is at 13.86% HP and Swampert is at 43.42% HP and received an Attack drop from Intimidate. Mantine has Haze to reset Gyarados's boosts. My primary goal now is to prevent Gyarados from sweeping. Using Haze is critical to neutralize the threat. After Haze, I will reassess if Mantine can stay in to deal damage or if a switch is necessary.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has revealed Dragon Dance, Double-Edge, and Leftovers. It has Intimidate. It has now accumulated one Dragon Dance boost. My Mantine has fainted, and I've lost the ability to use Haze. Kyogre is very low on HP. Swampert is switching in with reduced attack due to Intimidate. I need to be careful of Gyarados sweeping. Swampert needs to either hit hard with Ice Beam or force a switch. I must analyze the damage output and if Gyarados has any other coverage for Swampert. Will track Gyarados's next move and its current boosts.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has Leftovers and one Dragon Dance boost. Its known moves are Dragon Dance and Double-Edge. My Swampert is active, and its attack is lowered by Intimidate. My other Pokémon, Kyogre, is very low on HP. My Mantine has fainted. Swampert is at 49.63% HP. I need to output as much damage as possible onto Gyarados. Ice Beam is Super Effective and targets Gyarados's Defense rather than its boosted Attack. If Ice Beam fails to KO, Swampert will likely faint next turn, leaving me with a very low HP Kyogre against a potentially still boosted Gyarados. I need to keep track of Gyarados's HP after Ice Beam and evaluate if Kyogre can finish it off if Swampert faints. This is a critical turn to try and remove Gyarados to prevent a full sweep.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has Leftovers and one Dragon Dance boost. Its known moves are Dragon Dance, Double-Edge, and Earthquake. My Swampert is at very low HP and fainted a few turns later. My only remaining hope is Kyogre, also at very low HP. I need to bring in Kyogre to see if it can outspeed and revenge kill Gyarados. Kyogre's Drizzle will also bring weather back to rain, boosting its Water moves and allowing Thunder to hit with 100% accuracy. Regardless of whether Kyogre survives, this is my last offensive option. After this turn, I will need to assess if Kyogre can survive a hit and counter-attack, or if it will be a lost cause and I can only hope for hail chip damage or another unexpected turn of events.

previous turn):\nOpponent's Gengar has Levitate. Known moves for Gengar could be Thunderbolt, Ice Punch, Psychic, Will-O-Wisp, Counter. Gyarados has Earthquake, Hidden Power (Dark), Double-Edge, and Dragon Dance. Earthquake is negated by Levitate. Hidden Power (Dark) is not very effective. Double-Edge is neutral but Gengar will outspeed and deal significant damage. Dragon Dance sets up Gyarados. Given the intimidate, I will use Dragon Dance. If Gengar switches, I gain a free setup. If Gengar attacks, I can assess the damage and potentially outspeed and hit hard next turn. My team has Kyogre, Mantine, and Swampert. Kyogre is weak to Gengar's Thunderbolt. Mantine is also weak to Electric, but neutral to Ghost. Swampert resists Electric but is neutral to Ghost. Gengar outspeeds at base. After a Dragon Dance, Gyarados's Speed would be boosted. I am predicting that Gengar will attack offensively, so a Dragon Dance will allow me to outspeed and hit hard. It is a risk, but it's the optimal play, as my other pokemon does not resist gengar's attacks so i would not want to switch.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, which means I've lost an intimidate user and a potential physical sweeper. The opponent's Gengar is out. I've switched in Kyogre which brings Drizzle. Kyogre can threaten Gengar with STAB Surf, and Thunder under Drizzle will have 100% accuracy. I need to observe if Gengar stays in or switches out. If Gengar stays in, I will use Surf next turn. If Gengar switches, I'll assess the new threat and plan accordingly. I will note that Gengar's known move is Thunderbolt, making my Mantine a less desirable switch-in against it if I had wanted to preserve Kyogre.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, but Kyogre is in and has set up Rain. Gengar's known move is Thunderbolt. Kyogre has STAB Surf and 100% accurate Thunder under Rain, both super effective on Gengar. Kyogre's Special Attack is very high. I need to keep in mind Gengar's potential coverage moves (e.g., Psychic, Ice Punch) for my other Pokémon. My Mantine is weak to Electric, and Swampert, while resisting Electric, is neutral to Ghost. I will try to take down Gengar with Kyogre before it causes more damage. Kyogre's Leftovers recovery is also helpful. Next turns, I'll monitor for opponent's switches and potential Gengar moves to update my strategy.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, but Kyogre is in and has set up Rain. Gengar's known move is Thunderbolt, but it's now at very low HP. Kyogre has STAB Surf and 100% accurate Thunder under Rain, both super effective on Gengar. Kyogre's Special Attack is very high. I need to keep in mind Gengar's potential coverage moves (e.g., Psychic, Ice Punch) for my other Pokémon. My Mantine is weak to Electric, and Swampert, while resisting Electric, is neutral to Ghost. I will try to take down Gengar with Kyogre before it causes more damage. Kyogre's Leftovers recovery is also helpful. Now that Gengar is nearly fainted, Surf should finish it off. After Gengar is defeated, I will reassess the opponent's next Pokémon and adjust my strategy, considering my remaining team members Mantine and Swampert.\n\nOpponent's Gengar fainted, Heracross fainted. Kecleon is now active. Its ability is Color Change. Kyogre has Leftovers for recovery. Knowing Kecleon's ability means I should vary my attacks or boost before attacking if I want to maintain super-effective hits. Calm Mind is a good play to set up offensive and defensive stats. Next turn I will assess if Kecleon is a special or physical attacker and what its moves are. If Kecleon sets up or has a move like Toxic, I might be in trouble. I still have Mantine and Swampert in the back. Mantine can Haze if opponent sets up. Swampert provides Earthquake if needed. Kyogre is currently healthy, so boosting now is a good idea to prepare for future threats.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, and now Heracross and Gengar have also fainted from the opponent's side. The opponent's active Pokemon is Kecleon. It has Color Change, which means its type will change to the type of the last move that hit it. This makes it tricky to always hit with super effective moves. Kyogre is at very low health (56 HP out of 404), even after one Calm Mind boost. Kecleon hit with Return last turn, doing significant damage. Switching out Kyogre is a priority to protect it. Mantine, at full health, is a good switch-in here. It resists Normal and can hit back with Surf or Ice Beam. Swampert is also an option, but its Earthquake would make Kecleon a Ground type, which could then potentially set up to hit Swampert with a Grass or Ice move if it has coverage. Mantine is safer as it can take hits better due to its higher Special Defense and Flying typing against potential Ground moves. I need to keep track of Kecleon's revealed moves and assess if it has any status moves (e.g., Toxic, Thunder Wave) or setup moves. My win condition is to chip down Kecleon and then bring Kyogre back if needed for a sweep. Mantine also has Haze, which can be useful if Kecleon tries to set up. I'll use Mantine to wall Kecleon and try to get some damage in.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine is currently active and at low HP (19.46% after taking a Return). Switching Mantine out to Swampert is the optimal move to prevent Mantine from fainting and get a healthier Pokémon on the field. Swampert can take hits better due to its higher HP and Defense. Swampert's Earthquake will be effective against Kecleon, but I need to be careful of Color Change. If Kecleon becomes a Ground type, it might have moves that are super effective against Water/Ground types (like Grass or Ice). I need to observe Kecleon's moveset carefully, especially for status moves like Toxic or setup moves. My current win condition is to chip down Kecleon, preserve Kyogre, and exploit type matchups with Swampert and Mantine. Mantine still has Haze if needed against setup. I will evaluate Kecleon's next move against Swampert to better understand its capabilities.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine also took damage and is low. Swampert is currently active and took a hit from Kecleon's Return, but is still reasonably healthy at 56.33%. Kecleon is at 100% HP. Swampert's `Protect` is a tactical move to scout Kecleon's next play. If Kecleon attacks, I will learn its move and can better plan my next turn to either attack with Earthquake or switch if Kecleon has a super-effective move. After `Protect`, I will be better informed to decide whether to use Earthquake or switch out to Kyogre (who is very low) or Mantine (who is also low, but still has Haze if needed). The priority is to chip down Kecleon and preserve my other Pokémon for later, especially Kyogre for a potential late-game sweep. I will continue to track Kecleon's revealed moves and assess its type in relation to its attacks. Win condition relies on Kyogre sweeping or out-damaging Kecleon with Swampert and Mantine's combined efforts.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine also took damage and is low. Swampert is currently active and took a hit from Kecleon's Return. Swampert used Protect successfully last turn, confirming Kecleon's 'Return' move and its physical attacking nature. Swampert's Earthquake is a strong STAB option. If Kecleon switches, I will have dealt chip damage or forced a switch. If Kecleon stays in, Earthquake should deal substantial neutral damage. I still need to be aware of possible status moves (e.g., Toxic, Thunder Wave) or setup moves from Kecleon, as well as any unexpected coverage moves. My win condition relies on preserving Kyogre for a late-game sweep, and Swampert pushing damage now on Kecleon. I'll continue to monitor Kecleon's health and potential switches. Kecleon currently doesn't seem to pose an immediate super-effective threat to Swampert, but I'll update my assessment if further moves are revealed.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. Kecleon is now active with Color Change. Kyogre is at very low health and needs to be preserved. Mantine also took damage and is low. Swampert is currently active and took a hit from Kecleon's Return. Swampert used Protect successfully last turn, confirming Kecleon's 'Return' move and its physical attacking nature. Swampert hit Kecleon with Earthquake, turning Kecleon into a Ground type. Kecleon then used Return again, bringing Swampert to 37% HP. Kecleon is at 44% HP. Now that Kecleon is a Ground type, Hydro Pump will be super effective. This is a crucial turn to try and knock out Kecleon to preserve Swampert and my other low-HP Pokémon. I need to be mindful of its last revealed move, Return, which is a physical attack. Therefore, a special attack like Hydro Pump is the best choice to take advantage of the type change. If Kecleon survives, I will need to reassess based on its next move and the damage done. My win condition relies on preserving Kyogre for a late-game sweep and having Swampert remove Kecleon now.\n\nMy Gyarados fainted, Heracross and Gengar also fainted. The opponent's active Pokemon is now Gyarados. It has Intimidate which lowered Swampert's attack. Gyarados revealed it holds Leftovers. Swampert's Hydro Pump was resisted. Swampert is at 43.42% HP. Kyogre is at 13.86% HP and Mantine is at 19.46% HP. Given Gyarados's Intimidate and type resistance to Water, I need to be careful. Gyarados likely has Dragon Dance, making it a dangerous setup sweeper. Mantine has Haze which can nullify Gyarados's boosts. Switching to Mantine seems like the best play to scout the opponent's next move and potentially counter a Dragon Dance setup. I need to observe Gyarados's moveset, especially for any Electric or Rock-type coverage that would hit Mantine super effectively. If Gyarados sets up, Haze can be crucial. If it attacks, hopefully Mantine can take a hit and retaliate with Ice Beam or Surf, or toxic to whittle it down, or haze to prevent it from boosting. My goal is to prevent Gyarados from sweeping and preserve Kyogre for a late-game sweep if possible.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has revealed Dragon Dance and Leftovers. It has Intimidate. So far, its known moves include Dragon Dance. Swampert was hit by Gyarados's Hydro Pump, which was resisted. Gyarados is boosted in Attack and Speed. Mantine is at low HP (25.45%). My Kyogre is at 13.86% HP and Swampert is at 43.42% HP and received an Attack drop from Intimidate. Mantine has Haze to reset Gyarados's boosts. My primary goal now is to prevent Gyarados from sweeping. Using Haze is critical to neutralize the threat. After Haze, I will reassess if Mantine can stay in to deal damage or if a switch is necessary.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has revealed Dragon Dance, Double-Edge, and Leftovers. It has Intimidate. It has now accumulated one Dragon Dance boost. My Mantine has fainted, and I've lost the ability to use Haze. Kyogre is very low on HP. Swampert is switching in with reduced attack due to Intimidate. I need to be careful of Gyarados sweeping. Swampert needs to either hit hard with Ice Beam or force a switch. I must analyze the damage output and if Gyarados has any other coverage for Swampert. Will track Gyarados's next move and its current boosts.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has Leftovers and one Dragon Dance boost. Its known moves are Dragon Dance and Double-Edge. My Swampert is active, and its attack is lowered by Intimidate. My other Pokémon, Kyogre, is very low on HP. My Mantine has fainted. Swampert is at 49.63% HP. I need to output as much damage as possible onto Gyarados. Ice Beam is Super Effective and targets Gyarados's Defense rather than its boosted Attack. If Ice Beam fails to KO, Swampert will likely faint next turn, leaving me with a very low HP Kyogre against a potentially still boosted Gyarados. I need to keep track of Gyarados's HP after Ice Beam and evaluate if Kyogre can finish it off if Swampert faints. This is a critical turn to try and remove Gyarados to prevent a full sweep.\n\nOpponent's Gyarados has Leftovers and one Dragon Dance boost. Its known moves are Dragon Dance, Double-Edge, and Earthquake. My Swampert is at very low HP and fainted a few turns later. My only remaining hope is Kyogre, also at very low HP. I need to bring in Kyogre to see if it can outspeed and revenge kill Gyarados. Kyogre's Drizzle will also bring weather back to rain, boosting its Water moves and allowing Thunder to hit with 100% accuracy. Regardless of whether Kyogre survives, this is my last offensive option. After this turn, I will need to assess if Kyogre can survive a hit and counter-attack, or if it will be a lost cause and I can only hope for hail chip damage or another unexpected turn of events. If Kyogre falls, it's game over.\n\nMy entire team is effectively fainted. Kyogre is shown as fainted in the Team Status and Observations. Though the available actions show 'swampert' as a switch, this data is inconsistent with the active pokemon being kyogre and kyogre having fainted. Unless there's an error in the provided data where Swampert is still alive and not fainted, the game is over."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Swampert is the last remaining healthy Pokémon, though it's at low HP. All other Pokémon are fainted. My opponent's Gyarados is at 76% health and has one Dragon Dance boost, meaning its Attack and Speed are increased. It also has Leftovers for recovery. Gyarados's known moves are Dragon Dance, Double-Edge, and Earthquake. Swampert's Earthquake move will be neutral damage, and Ice Beam will be super effective against Gyarados. Given Gyarados's speed boost, it will likely outspeed Swampert. At this point, the best course of action is to try and chip at Gyarados with Ice Beam, as it's super effective.

Explosion on Metagross provides a strong early-game play to take out a potential problematic Pokémon or force an immediate switch. If Misdreavus does not switch, this turn will likely result in a KO. This will allow me to bring in a stronger offensive presence for the rest of the battle.\n\nMetagross fainted on turn 1. Opponent's Misdreavus is still at full health and used Protect. No items or moves revealed for Misdreavus besides Protect. Gyarados is a good switch-in with Intimidate to potentially lower Misdreavus's attack. If Misdreavus is a special attacker, Gyarados's bulk can still handle some hits to set up Dragon Dance. Kyogre and Mantine are good options for later if Misdreavus proves to be purely special.\n\nMisdreavus is still at full health after the Metagross Explosion and using Protect. Its item is unknown. Misdreavus is likely a special attacker given its typing, but its exact set is unconfirmed. My Gyarados is now in with an Intimidate drop on Misdreavus's attack. This turn I will set up with Dragon Dance to prepare for a potential sweep. If Misdreavus switches, I will have a boosted Gyarados against the next opponent. If it stays in and attacks, I can assess its damage and determine if I can continue boosting or need to attack directly next turn. Kyogre and Mantine are good backups if Gyarados falls or if Misdreavus becomes problematic. Specifically, Mantine resists water and flying, and has Haze so can deal with stat boosts.\n\nOpponent's Misdreavus used Protect. No items or moves revealed for Misdreavus besides Protect. Opponent switched to Claydol which is at 100% health, confirming it's an anti-lead. Gyarados has 1 Dragon Dance boost. Claydol is immune to Ground type attacks due to Levitate, so Earthquake is not effective. This is a critical error in my understanding of type matchups. I need to re-evaluate my move choice. My Gyarados's Hidden Power could be a useful attacking option if it's a type that hits Claydol super effectively. Given Gyarados's other moves are Dragon Dance (already used), and Double Edge (recoil is not ideal right now), I need to choose between Hidden Power and switching out. Since Claydol is still a relatively unknown threat, keeping Gyarados in and using Hidden Power to scout for its type seems like a reasonable play. If Hidden Power is a poor typing, I will consider switching to Kyogre or Mantine next turn, depending on Claydol's revealed moves. However, considering Claydol is immune to Earthquake, and Hidden Power is the only other direct attacking move besides Double-Edge (which I want to avoid recoil on), I'll go for Hidden Power. If Hidden Power is Fighting, Ghost, Dark, or Bug, it will hit Claydol super effectively. If it's something else, it's still better than a guaranteed ineffective Earthquake or recoiling Double-Edge without knowing the opponent's strategy. There is a possibility that Claydol is a special attacker and Gyarados might take a hit, but with one Dragon Dance, Gyarados should be relatively fast and can outspeed many Pokémon right now.\n\nMy Metagross fainted early, but Gyarados has successfully set up a Dragon Dance and dealt significant damage to Heracross. The opponent has revealed Misdreavus, Claydol, and Heracross. Misdreavus seems to be a defensive/support type. Claydol was likely an anti-lead. Heracross's item is Leftovers. I predicted a switch from Claydol to a more offensive threat, and Heracross fits that description, but is now heavily damaged. After this turn, if Heracross faints, I need to reassess my next move based on what the opponent sends out. I have Kyogre and Mantine as backups, both are fresh. Kyogre can set up Drizzle, boosting water moves, and Mantine can absorb water attacks and has Haze. Gyarados has 1 Dragon Dance boost, attack and speed increased (383 atk, 245 spe base). Heracross has been Intimidated once. Earthquake was resisted but landed a critical hit. Double-Edge is a strong neutral attack that should finish off Heracross. The recoil from Double-Edge will be minimal because Heracross is so low on health, and Gyarados is at full health right now.\n\nOpponent's Misdreavus was Intimidated by Gyarados but then switched out and has now switched back in, meaning the stat drop is gone. Misdreavus has only revealed Protect so far. Currently, Misdreavus has no stat boosts. My Gyarados has +1 Attack and +1 Speed. Given Misdreavus's ghost typing, Double-Edge will be a neutral hit, and Hidden Power would likely be super effective if it's Dark. Earthquake is useless due to Levitate. I will use Double-Edge to chip away at Misdreavus's health. My Gyarados is still at high health and has Leftovers recovery. My team has Kyogre and Mantine still fresh. Kyogre can set up Drizzle to boost Water moves, and Mantine can absorb Water attacks and has Haze to remove stat changes, which could be useful against a setup Misdreavus. I need to observe Misdreavus's next move to get a better read on its set. If Misdreavus attempts to set up, I should consider using Double-Edge twice to finish it off before it becomes a major threat.\n\nMisdreavus has revealed Protect, Taunt, and its ability Levitate. Its item is still unknown, but it's likely holding Leftovers given its bulk. Gyarados is taunted, meaning I cannot use Dragon Dance or other status moves. Hidden Power Dark is my only offensive move that can hit Misdreavus given its type and abilities, though it will not be super effective. I need to observe Misdreavus's next move to get a better read on its set. If it starts setting up, I need to consider switching to Kyogre or Mantine. Kyogre has Drizzle, which could turn the tide, and Mantine can Haze away stat boosts and is specially defensive. I need to keep track of the Taunt turns. My Gyarados has +1 Atk and +1 Spe."}], "response": {"reasoning": "Gyarados is currently trapped by Misdreavus's Mean Look, so switching out is not an option. Misdreavus has now revealed Protect, Taunt, and Mean Look, and its ability is Levitate. It's holding Leftovers for recovery. Gyarados's Double-Edge is ineffective due to Misdreavus's Ghost typing. Earthquake is ineffective due to Levitate. This leaves only Hidden Power (Dark) as a viable attacking option. Though not super effective, it's the only move that can deal damage, and Misdreavus is already chipped from the previous Hidden Power. Gyarados is at full health and has a +1 Attack and Speed boost. Misdreavus's moves so far indicate a supportive/stalling role rather than an offensive threat, so continuing to attack with Hidden Power is the best course of action to chip away at its HP.", "action": "hiddenpower", "scratchpad": "Opponent's Misdreavus is confirmed to be a support/stalling set with Protect, Taunt, Mean Look, and Leftovers. With Gyarados trapped, the current strategy is to repeatedly hit Misdreavus with Hidden Power and chip away its health until it faints. Gyarados has +1 Atk and Spe, which is beneficial for Hidden Power output. Since Taunt has ended, Dragon Dance is an option again, but directly attacking is better for now against a stalling threat while trapped. Once Misdreavus is dealt with, re-evaluate the opponent's remaining Pokemon (Claydol and one unknown) and plan for Kyogre or Mantine if Gyarados is unable to sweep. I need to keep in mind the remaining PP for Hidden Power and other moves, and if Misdreavus starts setting up stat changes once trapped, Haze from Mantine could be very useful."}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

Explosion on Metagross provides a strong early-game play to take out a potential problematic Pokémon or force an immediate switch. If Misdreavus does not switch, this turn will likely result in a KO. This will allow me to bring in a stronger offensive presence for the rest of the battle.\n\nMetagross fainted on turn 1. Opponent's Misdreavus is still at full health and used Protect. No items or moves revealed for Misdreavus besides Protect. Gyarados is a good switch-in with Intimidate to potentially lower Misdreavus's attack. If Misdreavus is a special attacker, Gyarados's bulk can still handle some hits to set up Dragon Dance. Kyogre and Mantine are good options for later if Misdreavus proves to be purely special.\n\nMisdreavus is still at full health after the Metagross Explosion and using Protect. Its item is unknown. Misdreavus is likely a special attacker given its typing, but its exact set is unconfirmed. My Gyarados is now in with an Intimidate drop on Misdreavus's attack. This turn I will set up with Dragon Dance to prepare for a potential sweep. If Misdreavus switches, I will have a boosted Gyarados against the next opponent. If it stays in and attacks, I can assess its damage and determine if I can continue boosting or need to attack directly next turn. Kyogre and Mantine are good backups if Gyarados falls or if Misdreavus becomes problematic. Specifically, Mantine resists water and flying, and has Haze so can deal with stat boosts.\n\nOpponent's Misdreavus used Protect. No items or moves revealed for Misdreavus besides Protect. Opponent switched to Claydol which is at 100% health, confirming it's an anti-lead. Gyarados has 1 Dragon Dance boost. Claydol is immune to Ground type attacks due to Levitate, so Earthquake is not effective. This is a critical error in my understanding of type matchups. I need to re-evaluate my move choice. My Gyarados's Hidden Power could be a useful attacking option if it's a type that hits Claydol super effectively. Given Gyarados's other moves are Dragon Dance (already used), and Double Edge (recoil is not ideal right now), I need to choose between Hidden Power and switching out. Since Claydol is still a relatively unknown threat, keeping Gyarados in and using Hidden Power to scout for its type seems like a reasonable play. If Hidden Power is a poor typing, I will consider switching to Kyogre or Mantine next turn, depending on Claydol's revealed moves. However, considering Claydol is immune to Earthquake, and Hidden Power is the only other direct attacking move besides Double-Edge (which I want to avoid recoil on), I'll go for Hidden Power. If Hidden Power is Fighting, Ghost, Dark, or Bug, it will hit Claydol super effectively. If it's something else, it's still better than a guaranteed ineffective Earthquake or recoiling Double-Edge without knowing the opponent's strategy. There is a possibility that Claydol is a special attacker and Gyarados might take a hit, but with one Dragon Dance, Gyarados should be relatively fast and can outspeed many Pokémon right now.\n\nMy Metagross fainted early, but Gyarados has successfully set up a Dragon Dance and dealt significant damage to Heracross. The opponent has revealed Misdreavus, Claydol, and Heracross. Misdreavus seems to be a defensive/support type. Claydol was likely an anti-lead. Heracross's item is Leftovers. I predicted a switch from Claydol to a more offensive threat, and Heracross fits that description, but is now heavily damaged. After this turn, if Heracross faints, I need to reassess my next move based on what the opponent sends out. I have Kyogre and Mantine as backups, both are fresh. Kyogre can set up Drizzle, boosting water moves, and Mantine can absorb water attacks and has Haze. Gyarados has 1 Dragon Dance boost, attack and speed increased (383 atk, 245 spe base). Heracross has been Intimidated once. Earthquake was resisted but landed a critical hit. Double-Edge is a strong neutral attack that should finish off Heracross. The recoil from Double-Edge will be minimal because Heracross is so low on health, and Gyarados is at full health right now.\n\nOpponent's Misdreavus was Intimidated by Gyarados but then switched out and has now switched back in, meaning the stat drop is gone. Misdreavus has only revealed Protect so far. Currently, Misdreavus has no stat boosts. My Gyarados has +1 Attack and +1 Speed. Given Misdreavus's ghost typing, Double-Edge will be a neutral hit, and Hidden Power would likely be super effective if it's Dark. Earthquake is useless due to Levitate. I will use Double-Edge to chip away at Misdreavus's health. My Gyarados is still at high health and has Leftovers recovery. My team has Kyogre and Mantine still fresh. Kyogre can set up Drizzle to boost Water moves, and Mantine can absorb Water attacks and has Haze to remove stat changes, which could be useful against a setup Misdreavus. I need to observe Misdreavus's next move to get a better read on its set. If Misdreavus attempts to set up, I should consider using Double-Edge twice to finish it off before it becomes a major threat.\n\nMisdreavus has revealed Protect, Taunt, and its ability Levitate. Its item is still unknown, but it's likely holding Leftovers given its bulk. Gyarados is taunted, meaning I cannot use Dragon Dance or other status moves. Hidden Power Dark is my only offensive move that can hit Misdreavus given its type and abilities, though it will not be super effective. I need to observe Misdreavus's next move to get a better read on its set. If it starts setting up, I need to consider switching to Kyogre or Mantine. Kyogre has Drizzle, which could turn the tide, and Mantine can Haze away stat boosts and is specially defensive. I need to keep track of the Taunt turns. My Gyarados has +1 Atk and +1 Spe.\n\nOpponent's Misdreavus is confirmed to be a support/stalling set with Protect, Taunt, Mean Look, and Leftovers. With Gyarados trapped, the current strategy is to repeatedly hit Misdreavus with Hidden Power and chip away its health until it faints. Gyarados has +1 Atk and Spe, which is beneficial for Hidden Power output. Since Taunt has ended, Dragon Dance is an option again, but directly attacking is better for now against a stalling threat while trapped. Once Misdreavus is dealt with, re-evaluate the opponent's remaining Pokemon (Claydol and one unknown) and plan for Kyogre or Mantine if Gyarados is unable to sweep. I need to keep in mind the remaining PP for Hidden Power and other moves, and if Misdreavus starts setting up stat changes once trapped, Haze from Mantine could be very useful."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Gyarados is trapped by Misdreavus's Mean Look. Misdreavus has been revealed to be a defensive/support Pokémon with Protect, Taunt, and Mean Look, and is holding Leftovers. My Gyarados is at full HP, has +1 Attack and +1 Speed from a Dragon Dance, and the Taunt effect has worn off. Misdreavus's current HP at 92% is still high, meaning I need to continue to chip away at its health. Hidden Power Dark is supereffective against Misdreavus. I need to keep attacking to eliminate this threat before it can continue to stall or attempt to set up a win condition (though that seems unlikely given its revealed moves so far). Double-Edge would be immune. Earthquake is immune. Dragon Dance is not needed as Gyarados already has +1. Therefore, the optimal play is to use Hidden Power Dark to continue damaging Misdreavus.", "action": "hiddenpower", "scratchpad": "My Metagross fainted early, but Gyarados has successfully set up a Dragon Dance and chipped away at Misdreavus's health.

Need to determine its item (Choice Scarf is common). Lapras should use Ice Beam. If Zapdos survives, then I can reconsider based on its damage output and any revealed moves.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos and Mew revealed. Mew took 24% from Ice Beam. This suggests Mew is either physically defensive or has lower special defense investment if it's a special attacker. Lapras has good special defense and HP, so it can take hits from Mew. Need to watch for Mew's moveset, especially if it has a way to boost its stats. If Mew uses Calm Mind, it could become a threat. My Groudon, Salamence, and Cradily are good switch-ins for different situations against Mew, but staying in with Lapras seems optimal for now. I should anticipate a potential setup or switch from the opponent. If Mew reveals a setup move, I might consider switching to a hard-hitting physical attacker like Groudon or Salamence, if it can outspeed the boosted Mew.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos and Mew. Mew appears to be a special attacker with Thunder; it's at 50% HP. My Lapras is paralyzed and at 51% HP. Switching to Groudon. Groudon resists Electric. Need to identify more of Mew's moveset, especially if it has a way to deal with Ground types. If Mew stays in, Groudon can use Earthquake for a quick KO. If Zapdos comes back, Groudon can threaten with Overheat or a boosted Earthquake. Future considerations include identifying Mew's item and full moveset, and looking for opportunities to set up with Groudon or Salamence.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos and Mew revealed. Mew is likely a special attacker, confirmed by Thunder. It's at 50% HP. Groudon is immune to Thunder and can easily OHKO Mew with Earthquake. Need to monitor what the opponent switches into if Mew faints. If Zapdos comes back, Groudon can still threaten it with Overheat or a boosted Earthquake if I manage to set up later. If another Pokémon is revealed, I will assess type matchups and potential threats. My Lapras is paralyzed and at half HP, so bringing it in prematurely is not ideal. Salamence and Cradily are healthy and offer different resistances and attacking options.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos and Tyranitar left. Mew is KO'd. Groudon is at full health. Tyranitar's known ability is Sand Stream. Currently, Sandstorm weather is active. Groudon has a type advantage against Tyranitar. I need to observe if Tyranitar has any unexpected moves or item that might compromise my Groudon. If Tyranitar survives and can hit Groudon hard, I'll need to consider switching or setting up. Lapras is paralyzed and at low HP, Salamence and Cradily are healthy and can be considered for future switches depending on the opponent's next move. My Groudon's Attack stat is high, so an unboosted Earthquake should do significant damage, potentially OHKOing or 2HKOing Tyranitar.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos remaining and potentially one other unknown Pokémon. Mew and Tyranitar are fainted. Groudon is healthy and offensively strong. Zapdos is vulnerable to Fire-type moves. I will continue to pressure with Groudon's Overheat. If Zapdos survives, I will re-evaluate based on its damage output and any revealed moves. I need to keep track of Groudon's Overheat stat drop after use and be mindful of Zapdos's speed to determine if it's Choice Scarfed. Lapras is parked due to paralysis and low health (and Electric weak). Salamence and Cradily are healthy alternatives if Groudon gets into trouble.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos remaining and one unknown Pokémon. Mew and Tyranitar are fainted. Groudon is healthy and still has offensive presence despite the -2 Special Attack. Zapdos is vulnerable to Fire-type moves. I will continue to pressure with Groudon's Overheat to secure the KO on Zapdos. After Zapdos is out, I will need to reassess the situation based on the opponent's last Pokémon. I've noted that Zapdos is at ~70% HP. My Lapras is still paralyzed and at low HP, so it's a last resort switch. Salamence and Cradily are healthy and can be considered for future switches depending on the opponent's last Pokémon, especially if it's a physical attacker that Salamence's Intimidate could help with or a special attacker that Cradily's special bulk could tank. I must consider what the opponent's last Pokémon could be, thinking about common Gen 3 Ubers cores. Once Zapdos is gone, I will have a better read on their remaining team and can plan for the endgame.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos remaining and one unknown Pokémon. Mew and Tyranitar are fainted. Groudon is healthy. Zapdos is now at 52% HP. Groudon's Special Attack is at -4. I predict Overheat will still secure the KO, given Zapdos's current HP and its weakness to Fire. After Zapdos is eliminated, I will need to consider type matchups and threats presented by the opponent's last Pokémon. If the last Pokémon is physical, Salamence's Intimidate could be useful. If it's special, Cradily could serve as a check. Lapras is still paralyzed and low on health, so it's a last resort.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos remaining and one unknown Pokémon. Mew and Tyranitar are fainted. Groudon is healthy. Zapdos is at ~41% HP and I predict it will be knocked out this turn by Overheat despite Groudon's -6 Special Attack. After Zapdos is eliminated, I will need to consider type matchups and threats presented by the opponent's last Pokémon. If the last Pokémon is physical, Salamence's Intimidate could be useful. If it's special, Cradily could serve as a check, or Lapras if it's not a strong super-effective hit and I can pivot out of paralysis later. I need to keep in mind their last Pokémon's potential offensive and defensive capabilities to plan my endgame. It's crucial to identify if the last Pokémon is another special attacker, a physical attacker, or a setup sweeper. Once Zapdos is gone, I will have a clearer picture for optimal strategy.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos remaining and one unknown Pokémon. Mew and Tyranitar are fainted. Groudon is healthy but its special attack is severely lowered. Zapdos is at ~32% HP. Given Groudon's -6 Special Attack, Overheat is no longer an effective move to secure the KO. Bringing in Salamence provides Intimidate for potential physical threats and a fresh attacker. Salamence's Fire Blast can deal with Zapdos if it stays in, or it can use Dragon Claw to pressure their next Pokémon. I need to observe their last Pokémon's type and role. If their last Pokémon is still threatening after Zapdos is dealt with, Lapras and Cradily are still available, though Lapras is paralyzed and low on health. The key is to keep momentum and preserve options for the endgame.\n\nOpponent has Zapdos remaining and one unknown Pokémon. Mew and Tyranitar are fainted. Groudon is healthy and immune to Zapdos's Thunderbolt. I have switched to Groudon to wall Zapdos's Electric attacks and gain momentum. Groudon can either use Earthquake or set up Swords Dance if Zapdos is switched out, or use Overheat if I predict Zapdos to stay in, despite Groudon's previous Special Attack drops (which are reset due to switching). If Zapdos stays in, Groudon's Overheat, even unboosted, will likely finish it off given Zapdos's low health. After Zapdos is eliminated, I will need to consider type matchups and threats presented by the opponent's last Pokémon. If the last Pokémon is physical, Salamence's Intimidate could be useful again. If it's special, Cradily could serve as a check, or Lapras if it's not a strong super-effective hit and I can pivot out of paralysis later. I need to keep in mind their last Pokémon's potential offensive and defensive capabilities to plan my endgame. It's crucial to identify if the last Pokémon is another special attacker, a physical attacker, or a setup sweeper. Once Zapdos is gone, I will have a clearer picture for optimal strategy."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Groudon is at full health and currently active after switching in. The opponent's Zapdos is at 38% health, and Groudon is immune to its Thunderbolt. The weather is Sunny Day due to Groudon's Drought ability. While Groudon's Overheat would benefit from Sunny Day, its special attack was severely lowered in previous turns. However, due to switching out and back in, Groudon's boosts (and unboosts) have been reset. This means Overheat will hit with full force. Given Zapdos's low health, a super-effective Overheat will undoubtedly KO it. This will eliminate their Zapdos and allow me to face their last unknown Pokémon with a healthy Groudon.", "action": "overheat", "scratchpad": "Opponent has Zapdos remaining and one unknown Pokémon.

previous turn):\nOpponent led with Wynaut, confirming Shadow Tag. Since I'm locked in, I need to try and take out Wynaut before it uses Mirror Coat or Counter. Shadow Ball is my best bet for super effective damage. Will need to keep track of Wynaut's HP to know when it might use a revenge move. My Shiftry is Choice Banded, so I will be locked into Shadow Ball afterwards and need to consider further switches once Wynaut is down.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut was knocked out by Shadow Ball. Opponent switched to Medicham, a very offensive threat with Pure Power. Shiftry is locked into Shadow Ball due to Choice Band. Shiftry is not resistant to Fighting or Psychic attacks, and Medicham with Pure Power could easily OHKO. I will attack with Shadow Ball this turn, then assess the situation for a switch next turn. Need to consider my remaining team members for handling Medicham. Jirachi is Steel/Psychic, so it resists Psychic and is neutral to Fighting, but Medicham's attack power is immense. Salamence resists Fighting. Omastar is weak to Fighting. This turn, Shadow Ball is mandatory.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut confirmed Shadow Tag, but is now fainted. Medicham has Pure Power and knows Brick Break. It is a massive physical threat. My Shiftry has fainted. I need to bring in a Pokemon to deal with Medicham. Salamence resists Fighting, making it a good pivot. Jirachi can take neutral damage but might be overwhelmed. Omastar is a definite no. After this switch, I will assess Medicham's next move and plan accordingly. Salamence has Intimidate, which will lower Medicham's attack, further mitigating its threat. This is a crucial detail for surviving hits.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut (Shadow Tag) is fainted. Opponent's Shiftry is fainted. Currently facing Medicham (Pure Power, -1 Attack from Intimidate). Medicham is an extremely dangerous physical attacker. Need to be wary of its Speed and potential for other coverage moves (Psychic, Ice Punch, Thunder Punch, etc.). My Salamence is currently at full HP and has effectively controlled Medicham's immediate threat with Intimidate. My other available Pokémon are Jirachi (Steel/Psychic, physically bulky, good special attacker) and Omastar (Rock/Water, good special attacker and Spikes setter, but very frail physically and weak to Fighting). Jirachi could potentially wall Medicham if it only carries Fighting moves, but Psychic would be a neutral hit and I need to avoid getting chipped down unnecessarily. Salamence seems like the best choice to continue pressuring Medicham while having defensive utility. If Medicham switches out, I need to reassess based on what comes in. I will continue to pressure with Dragon Claw since it is a reliable STAB move that hits Medicham neutrally.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut (Shadow Tag) fainted. Opponent's Shiftry fainted. Opponent's Medicham is at -1 Attack from my Salamence's Intimidate. Latios is currently active and severely weakened. I need to keep track of opponent's remaining Pokemon. The opponent has lost 2/4 Pokemon, I have lost 1/4. I maintain an advantage. Securing a knockout on Latios will further cement this advantage. Jirachi and Omastar are still healthy. I need to be prepared for the opponent to switch out Latios to preserve it, in which case I will need to assess the new threat and determine if Salamence is still the best option or if a switch to Jirachi or Omastar is more appropriate. For now, continuing the offensive pressure is key.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut (Shadow Tag) fainted. Opponent's Shiftry fainted. Opponent's Medicham is at -1 Attack from my Salamence's Intimidate. Latios is currently active and severely weakened. I need to keep track of opponent's remaining Pokemon. The opponent has lost 2/4 Pokemon, I have lost 1/4. I maintain an advantage.

I need to be prepared for the opponent to switch out Latios to preserve it, in which case I will need to assess the new threat and determine if Jirachi is still the best option or if Omastar is more appropriate. Jirachi has an advantage against Latios due to type matchups and bulk. I will try to finish off Latios with Jirachi next turn, if it doesn't switch out. If the opponent switches into Medicham, I will need to consider Jirachi's bulk and attack stats to determine if it can survive and counter.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut (Shadow Tag) fainted. Opponent's Shiftry fainted. Opponent's Salamence fainted. Currently facing Latios at low health. Jirachi is healthy and has an excellent offensive typing against Latios. My team has 2 fainted Pokemon (Shiftry, Salamence) while the opponent has 3 fainted (Wynaut, Shiftry, Salamence). I have a clear advantage. If Latios is taken out, the only remaining known threat is Medicham. Jirachi should be able to handle Medicham, especially if it gets Calm Mind boosts off. Omastar is a good late-game clean-up or Spikes setter. I need to be mindful of Medicham's moveset if it comes in next.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut (Shadow Tag) fainted. Opponent's Shiftry fainted. Opponent's Salamence fainted. Currently facing Latios at 80% health and -1 SpD. Jirachi is healthy. My team has 2 fainted Pokemon (Shiftry, Salamence), while the opponent has 3 fainted (Wynaut, Shiftry, Salamence). I have a clear advantage. If Latios is taken out, the only remaining known threat is Medicham. Jirachi should be able to handle Medicham, especially if it gets Calm Mind boosts off. Omastar is a good late-game clean-up or Spikes setter. I need to be mindful of Medicham's moveset if it comes in next. Prioritize taking out Latios with Psychic. If Medicham comes in, I can consider Calm Mind or Fire Punch.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut (Shadow Tag) fainted. Opponent's Shiftry fainted. Opponent's Salamence fainted. Currently facing Latios at 100% health but with -1 Sp. Def. Jirachi is healthy. My team has 2 fainted Pokemon (Shiftry, Salamence), while the opponent has 3 fainted (Wynaut, Shiftry, Salamence). I have a clear advantage. If Latios is taken out, the only remaining known threat is Medicham. Jirachi should be able to handle Medicham, especially if it gets Calm Mind boosts off. Omastar is a good late-game clean-up or Spikes setter. I need to be mindful of Medicham's moveset if it comes in next. Latios's repeated Recover suggests it's trying to stall or get an opportunity to switch. I need to continue the offensive pressure with Psychic to remove it as a threat. If Medicham comes in, I can consider Calm Mind or Fire Punch.\n\nOpponent's Wynaut (Shadow Tag) fainted. Opponent's Shiftry fainted. Opponent's Salamence fainted. Currently facing Latios at 79% health and -2 Sp. Def. Jirachi is paralyzed but at 42.23% HP.

previous turn):\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Need to re-evaluate the opponent's team after Wynaut is dealt with.\n\nOpponent led with Wynaut, which is a trap-and-reflect Pokémon. It's likely they used Mirror Coat or Counter and I used a strong attack. Since both are fainted, I need to bring in a new Pokémon. Jirachi is a good choice as it has good bulk, special attack, and can set up with Calm Mind. Knowing Wynaut was their lead suggests they might have a slower, bulkier team or other setup Pokémon that Wynaut can enable. I'll need to observe their next switch carefully.\n\nMy Shiftry and opponent's Wynaut are both fainted. I have Jirachi active against a fresh Latios. Latios typically runs a special attacking set with moves like Draco Meteor, Psychic/Psyshock, Surf/Thunderbolt, and Recover/Calm Mind. Jirachi is naturally bulky and can take a hit, but Latios's speed and likely STAB moves are a concern. I need to observe Latios's move and assess its item (e.g., Choice Scarf, Life Orb) to determine future plays. My Jirachi has Leftovers for passive recovery. Calm Mind could be useful if I can safely set up, perhaps after Latios reveals a move that I can wall or if I predict a switch. For now, a direct Psychic attack seems prudent to chip away at its health and gather more information.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi is out against Latios. Latios likely has a Choice Scarf given it outsped Jirachi and used Psychic. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios's item is still unconfirmed but suspected Choice Scarf. If Latios is Choice Scarf locked into Psychic, Omastar is a good switch-in due to its Psychic resistance. If Latios is not Choice Scarf, it could use different moves, but Omastar's bulk is still decent for a switch-in. Need to continue to gather information on Latios's moveset and item.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi is out against Latios. Latios likely has a Choice Scarf given it outsped Jirachi and used Psychic. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios's item is still unconfirmed but suspected Choice Scarf. Last turn, Latios missed its Thunder, which means it might be locked into it if it's Choice Scarf, allowing Omastar to freely attack. My Omastar is at full health. Using Ice Beam now seems like the best play to chip away at or potentially OHKO Latios. Keeping track of Latios's moveset: only Thunder and Psychic are revealed, and an unknown item. If Latios is Choice Scarf locked into Thunder, it won't be able to hit Omastar super effectively. Next turn, I can consider Spikes or Hydro Pump to press the advantage against their next switch-in. I will assume Latios takes significant damage from Ice Beam due to its Dragon/Flying typing.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi came out against Latios. Latios likely has a Choice Scarf given it outsped Jirachi and used Psychic initially, but this is less certain now with the varied moves used. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Last turn, Latios used Ice Beam, dealing significant damage to Omastar. This confirms Latios has Psychic, Thunder, and Ice Beam. Latios's item is still unconfirmed. My Omastar is at 53% HP, Latios is at 45% HP. Another Ice Beam might be enough to KO Latios, or at least severely weaken it for Salamence/Jirachi to handle later. Hydro Pump is a risk due to accuracy. Spikes is not the move for this turn as we need to apply offensive pressure. It's crucial for Omastar to secure this KO to maintain momentum. Need to consider Latios's fourth move and potential item (e.g., Choice Specs for maximum damage, or Life Orb). Given Latios has used three different moves, it is not Choice Scarf locked, hence it could be Choice Specs, Life Orb or another item. If Omastar fails to KO, it will likely be forced out or knocked out.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi came out against Latios. Latios likely had a Choice Scarf given it outsped Jirachi and used Psychic initially, but this is less certain now with the varied moves used. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios's item is still unconfirmed, but based on past turns, it's not Choice Scarf. Now Omastar is active and extremely low on health, as is Latios. We've seen Latios use Psychic, Thunder, and Ice Beam, which suggests a special attacking set. It is critical for Omastar to secure this KO to maintain momentum, and Ice Beam is the most reliable option given the accuracy. If Omastar KOs Latios, the opponent will be down to only one known Pokémon, the paralyzed Jirachi.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi came out against Latios. Latios had Psychic, Thunder, and Ice Beam, suggesting a special attacking set, and it is not Choice Scarf. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios was KO'd by Omastar. Now Medicham is active and frozen, while Omastar is critically low on health. My Omastar will likely be KO'd by Medicham if it thaws. Laying Spikes is the best strategic option to gain some value from Omastar before it faints, providing entry hazard support for my remaining Pokémon (Jirachi and Salamence). Jirachi is paralyzed for now, and Salamence is at full health and a powerful offensive threat. The opponent's team currently shows Wynaut (fainted), Latios (fainted), and Medicham (frozen, 46% HP), meaning they have one more unknown Pokémon. Spikes will apply pressure to their next switch-in. Omastar will likely faint next turn, so maximizing its utility now is key.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi came out against Latios. Latios had Psychic, Thunder, and Ice Beam, suggesting a special attacking set, and it is not Choice Scarf. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios was KO'd by Omastar. Medicham is active and frozen, while Omastar is critically low on health. Omastar laid Spikes before switching out. Now Salamence is entering against a full-health Misdreavus. Misdreavus is a ghost type, which means it's immune to Normal and Fighting moves. It might be a special attacker given its common sets. Salamence should be able to threaten Misdreavus significantly with its STAB Dragon Claw or potentially Fire Blast. I need to observe Misdreavus's move and item to determine its role better. My team currently has Jirachi (paralyzed, 33% HP) and Salamence (100% HP) remaining. Opponent has Medicham (frozen, 46% HP) and Misdreavus (100% HP) plus one unknown Pokémon. My initial plan is to attack with Salamence to maintain offensive pressure. I will consider using Fire Blast next turn if I anticipate a Steel-type switch-in.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi came out against Latios. Latios had Psychic, Thunder, and Ice Beam, suggesting a special attacking set, and it is not Choice Scarf. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios was KO'd by Omastar. Medicham is active and frozen, while Omastar is critically low on health. Omastar laid Spikes before switching out. Now Salamence is entering against a full-health Misdreavus. Misdreavus is a ghost type, which means it's immune to Normal and Fighting moves. It also used Taunt, preventing Salamence from using status moves like Dragon Dance. Salamence's Intimidate lowered Misdreavus's attack. Salamence's moves are Dragon Claw, Brick Break, Hidden Power (need to confirm typing of HP but likely not ideal), and Fire Blast. Fire Blast is the best super effective move against any potential Steel-type switch ins or for raw damage against Misdreavus. My team currently has Jirachi (paralyzed, 33% HP) and Salamence (100% HP) remaining. Opponent has Medicham (frozen, 46% HP) and Misdreavus (100% HP) plus one unknown Pokémon. Given Salamence cannot use status moves due to Taunt, I will use Fire Blast on Misdreavus. Misdreavus's moveset is still mostly unknown. Dragon Claw is an option but Fire Blast provides wider coverage and higher damage output against potential switch-ins. If Misdreavus is special attacking, Salamence's Special Defense should hold up. Misdreavus cannot use status moves right now due to Taunt, which removes some immediate threats.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi came out against Latios. Latios had Psychic, Thunder, and Ice Beam, suggesting a special attacking set, and it is not Choice Scarf. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios was KO'd by Omastar. Medicham is active and frozen, while Omastar was critically low on health. Omastar laid Spikes before switching out. Now Salamence is entering against a full-health Misdreavus. Misdreavus is a ghost type, which means it's immune to Normal and Fighting moves. It also used Taunt, preventing Salamence from using status moves. Salamence's Intimidate lowered Misdreavus's attack. Misdreavus used Protect last turn, indicating it might be a bulkier/stall set. The Taunt on Salamence has ended. Misdreavus shows Taunt and Protect. I need to be careful of Will-O-Wisp, Pain Split, or other disruptive Ghost-type moves. Fire Blast is my strongest option to attack Misdreavus directly. My team has Jirachi (paralyzed, 33% HP) and Salamence (100% HP) remaining. Opponent has Medicham (frozen, 46% HP) and Misdreavus (100% HP) plus one unknown Pokémon. I need to identify the last Pokémon and manage the frozen Medicham. Salamence has good special attack and Fire Blast provides coverage against potential Steel types or other threats. Misdreavus's moveset is still mostly unknown beyond Taunt and Protect, making strong offensive pressure important.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack. Both Wynaut and Shiftry fainted. Jirachi came out against Latios. Latios had Psychic, Thunder, and Ice Beam, suggesting a special attacking set, and it is not Choice Scarf. Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios was KO'd by Omastar. Medicham is active and frozen. Omastar laid Spikes before switching out. Salamence is now active against Misdreavus, which has revealed Taunt and Protect. Salamence's Intimidate lowered Misdreavus's attack. Salamence successfully hit Misdreavus with Fire Blast last turn, reducing its HP to 65%. My team has Jirachi (paralyzed, 33% HP) and Salamence (100% HP) remaining. Opponent has Medicham (frozen, 46% HP) and Misdreavus (65% HP) plus one unknown Pokémon. Second Fire Blast should knock out Misdreavus. After Misdreavus is KO'd, the goal is to deal with the frozen Medicham and then their last unknown Pokémon. Salamence holds Leftovers for passive recovery, which is beneficial for a long game.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack.

Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios was KO'd by Omastar. Medicham is active and frozen. Omastar laid Spikes before switching out. Salamence is now active against Misdreavus, which has revealed Taunt and Protect. Salamence's Intimidate lowered Misdreavus's attack. Salamence successfully hit Misdreavus with Fire Blast last turn, reducing its HP to 65%, and then again to 29%. My team has Jirachi (paralyzed, 33% HP) and Salamence (100% HP) remaining. Opponent has Medicham (frozen, 46% HP) and Misdreavus (29% HP) plus one unknown Pokémon. A second Fire Blast should knock out Misdreavus. After Misdreavus is KO'd, the goal is to deal with the frozen Medicham and then their last unknown Pokémon. Salamence holds Leftovers for passive recovery, which is beneficial for a long game. Taunt is active for one more turn, meaning Misdreavus cannot use any status moves against Salamence. This simplifies decision making for this turn. Continue with Fire Blast to finish off Misdreavus.\n\nOpponent started with Wynaut, indicating a potential lead focused on trapping and reflecting damage. My Shiftry has Choice Band, making it a powerful physical attacker but vulnerable to Mirror Coat/Counter. Explosion ensures a quick KO on Wynaut without risking a reflected attack.

Jirachi is paralyzed and has taken some damage. Latios was KO'd by Omastar. Medicham is active and frozen. Omastar laid Spikes before switching out. Salamence is now active and has KO'd my Misdreavus. My Latios is at 3% HP, and will likely be KO'd. Switching Latios for Jirachi is the best option to preserve Latios for potential future use or better positioning. Salamence has Fire Blast, Dragon Claw, Brick Break, and Hidden Power (type unknown). Jirachi is paralyzed but has Leftovers and can potentially set up Calm Mind if Salamence switches or use Psychic for damage. Opponent's known Pokémon are Medicham (frozen, 46% HP), Omastar (critically low health, already switched out and fainted), Latios (now at 3% HP and about to switch), Salamence (100% HP) and one unknown.

[],\n  \"switches\": [\n    \"skarmory\"\n  ]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent's Wobbuffet has Shadow Tag. It's likely carrying Counter/Mirror Coat/Destiny Bond/Safeguard. I need to chip away at it as much as possible since Heracross is trapped. Deoxys-Attack is a strong revenge killer, Omastar can set up Spikes, and Skarmory is a wall. I need to be careful with my switch-ins after Heracross goes down. I need to see what damage Focus Punch does to know the state of Wobbuffet. I'll need to send out a Pokémon that can tank a hit or set up quickly.\n\nHeracross fainted to Wobbuffet. Wobbuffet likely has Counter, Mirror Coat, Destiny Bond, and Safeguard. My Deoxys-Attack should use Shadow Ball to avoid Counter. Omastar or Skarmory could be potential switch-ins if Deoxys-Attack struggles. I need to keep track of Wobbuffet's HP and try to predict if it will use Destiny Bond or a damaging move. My team consists of Deoxys-Attack (offensive), Omastar (special attacker/spiker), and Skarmory (physical wall/spiker). I need to preserve my team members as much as possible against this Wobbuffet. Deoxys-Attack's high Special Attack combined with Shadow Ball's neutral damage will be my best bet to dealing significant damage to Wobbuffet.\n\nHeracross fainted to Wobbuffet's Counter. Wobbuffet is at 70% HP. Deoxys-Attack is now active and trapped by Shadow Tag. Standard Wobbuffet (Gen 3 Ubers) usually carries Counter, Mirror Coat, Destiny Bond, and Safeguard. My Deoxys-Attack's Defense is extremely low, making physical attacks from my side extremely risky because of Counter. My Special Defense is also low but better than my physical defense. Since Deoxys-Attack has high Special Attack and Shadow Ball is a special move, it's the safest option here. If Wobbuffet uses Mirror Coat, it will likely return a lot of damage, possibly OHKOing Deoxys-Attack, but it also means Wobbuffet takes substantial damage, potentially enough to be knocked out. If Wobbuffet doesn't use Mirror Coat, Shadow Ball has a good chance of dealing significant damage. The goal is to eliminate Wobbuffet as quickly as possible without losing another Pokémon unnecessarily. I have Omastar (special attacker/spiker) and Skarmory (physical wall/spiker) remaining. Losing Deoxys-Attack here is a calculated risk to remove the Wobbuffet threat.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have both fainted. Omastar is switching in against a Wobbuffet at 11% HP. My remaining Pokémon are Omastar (special attacker/spiker) and Skarmory (physical wall/spiker). The opponent's Wobbuffet has Shadow Tag. If Omastar can take out Wobbuffet, I gain significant momentum. I need to be prepared for another Wobbuffet trick (like Destiny Bond) but the low HP makes a direct attacking approach appealing. Once Wobbuffet is gone, I need to reassess the opponent's team composition and determine my win conditions. Omastar's Spikes can be very useful for chip damage later in the game. Skarmory provides phazing and physical bulk.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have both fainted, leaving Omastar and Skarmory. Wobbuffet is at 11% HP after a Shadow Ball, and its Special Defense was lowered. Omastar's Hydro Pump should secure the KO. Once Wobbuffet is out, I need to scout the rest of the opponent's team. Omastar provides hazards with Spikes and strong special attacking pressure. Skarmory is a physical wall and can also set up Spikes or phaze. My current win condition relies on preserving Omastar and Skarmory to deal with whatever comes next. I assume the opponent's team still has 2 other Pokémon, as 2 have already fainted from my side, and they started with 4. I need to be careful of potential other threats and try to get up Spikes if possible after Wobbuffet is down.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have both fainted. Omastar is currently active against Wobbuffet, which is at 11% HP and had its Special Defense lowered. Omastar's Hydro Pump missed last turn, and Wobbuffet used Counter. This turn, I will reattempt Hydro Pump to finish off Wobbuffet. Once Wobbuffet is gone, I will have Omastar and Skarmory remaining. I need to scout the opponent's next Pokémon and determine my next steps. Omastar can be a special attacker or set up Spikes, while Skarmory is a physical wall and also sets up Spikes. Gaining momentum by eliminating Wobbuffet is crucial.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is currently at full HP, and Skarmory is my last Pokémon. The opponent has lost Wobbuffet and now has Cradily active, and presumably two other unknown Pokémon. Cradily is Rock/Grass type, making it weak to Water and Ice. Omastar has Hydro Pump (STAB + super effective) and Ice Beam (super effective). Hydro Pump is higher base power but lower accuracy. Cradily often runs recovery (Recover/Ingrain), hazards (Stealth Rock), or status (Toxic). It can also be bulky with abilities like Suction Cups preventing phazing, making it a potential setup sweeper or wall. I need to observe Cradily's move set and item. For now, attacking with the most powerful super effective move is the best option to press advantage. If Cradily proves to be very bulky, I might consider setting up Spikes with Omastar later, or switching to Skarmory if Cradily poses a direct threat to Omastar.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP, and Skarmory is at full HP. The opponent has Cradily active (59% HP, Leftovers) and at least one other unknown Pokémon. Cradily has Earthquake, suggesting a physically offensive presence. It is Rock/Grass type, weak to Fighting, Bug, Ice, Steel, and x4 weak to Ground. My Omastar took a super-effective Earthquake hit. Skarmory is a good switch-in here as it resists Earthquake. Skarmory can set up Spikes, use Roar to phaze, or use Protect for scouting/Leftovers recovery. Omastar's Hydro Pump and Ice Beam are super effective, but Omastar's current HP makes staying in risky against repeated Earthquakes. I need to observe if Cradily has other offensive moves or setup moves. Skarmory will allow me to gather more information and potentially set up hazards.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP. Skarmory is at full HP. The opponent has Cradily active (65% HP, Leftovers) and at least one other unknown Pokémon. Cradily has Earthquake, which Skarmory is immune to. This turn, I am setting up Spikes with Skarmory. After Spikes are set, I need to consider using Roar to phaze Cradily or to scout the opponent's other Pokémon, or to Toxic it to start a timer. Cradily often runs Recover/Ingrain, so Toxic would be effective if it stays in. Omastar still poses a threat to Cradily with Hydro Pump/Ice Beam, but is fragile. Preserving Skarmory to set up multiple layers of Spikes and phaze is a key win condition.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP. Skarmory is at 84.73% HP and has set one layer of Spikes. The opponent has Cradily active (71% HP, Leftovers) that knows Earthquake and Rock Slide, and at least one other unknown Pokémon. Cradily is a Rock/Grass type, making it weak to Water and Ice. Skarmory is a good wall against Cradily because of its typing, resisting Rock Slide and being immune to Earthquake. My goal for Skarmory is to set up multiple layers of Spikes and then use Roar to phaze and rack up entry hazard damage. Omastar is still a potent special attacker with Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, but its lower HP makes it risky to bring in directly against Cradily. I need to keep track of PP for all moves, especially for Spikes, Roar, and Protect, which are crucial for Skarmory's role. Current plan: two layers of Spikes, then Roar to phaze and scout.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP. Skarmory is at 70.06% HP and has set one layer of Spikes. The opponent has Cradily active (77% HP, Leftovers) that knows Earthquake and Rock Slide, and at least one other unknown Pokémon. Cradily is a Rock/Grass type, making it weak to Water and Ice. Skarmory is a good wall against Cradily because of its typing, resisting Rock Slide and being immune to Earthquake. My goal for Skarmory is to set up multiple layers of Spikes and then use Roar to phaze and rack up entry hazard damage. Omastar is still a potent special attacker with Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, but its lower HP makes it risky to bring in directly against Cradily. I need to keep track of PP for all moves, especially for Spikes, Roar, and Protect, which are crucial for Skarmory's role. Current plan: two layers of Spikes, then Roar to phaze and scout. After two layers of Spikes are set, my next move will likely be Roar to maximize entry hazard damage on potential switch-ins and to scout the rest of the opponent's team. If Skarmory's HP gets critically low, I might consider Protect to gain Leftovers recovery or switch to Omastar if it can safely take a hit.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP. Skarmory is at 54.19% HP and has set two layers of Spikes. The opponent has Cradily active (83% HP, Leftovers) that knows Earthquake and Rock Slide, and at least one other unknown Pokémon. Cradily is a Rock/Grass type, making it weak to Water and Ice. Skarmory is a good wall against Cradily because of its typing, resisting Rock Slide and being immune to Earthquake. My goal for Skarmory is to set up multiple layers of Spikes and then use Roar to phaze and rack up entry hazard damage. Omastar is still a potent special attacker with Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, but its lower HP makes it risky to bring in directly against Cradily. I need to keep track of PP for all moves, especially for Spikes, Roar, and Protect, which are crucial for Skarmory's role. Current plan: three layers of Spikes, then Roar to phaze and scout. After three layers of Spikes are set, my next move will likely be Roar to maximize entry hazard damage on potential switch-ins and to scout the rest of the opponent's team. If Skarmory's HP gets critically low, I might consider Protect to gain Leftovers recovery or switch to Omastar if it can safely take a hit.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP and Skarmory is at 39.82% HP. Opponent's Wobbuffet has fainted. Cradily is at 89% HP with Leftovers. Cradily knows Earthquake and Rock Slide. Skarmory has successfully laid down three layers of Spikes. My immediate goal is to apply pressure with Roar to force a switch and inflict Spikes damage, while also scouting the opponent's remaining team. Skarmory is getting worn down by Rock Slide, so I need to be mindful of its HP. Omastar can still be a threat with Hydro Pump/Ice Beam, especially if a new Pokémon comes in that is weak to Water or Ice. I need to observe what the opponent switches into and prepare for that. Protect could be an option if Skarmory's health drops too low to get some Leftovers recovery, but Roar should be prioritized for now.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP and Skarmory is at 23.05% HP. Opponent's Wobbuffet has fainted. Cradily is at 95% HP with Leftovers. Cradily knows Earthquake and Rock Slide, and has Suction Cups. Skarmory has successfully laid down three layers of Spikes. Cradily's Suction Cups nullifies Skarmory's Roar. Skarmory is at low health. Protect is the best option now to gain Leftovers recovery and scout the opponent's next move. If Cradily attacks, Protect buys time. If Cradily tries to set up, Protect makes it waste a turn. After this turn, I will reassess Skarmory's HP and consider my options. Skarmory has set up Spikes, so its main role is largely completed. Now, it's about preserving relevant team members and trying to make favorable matchups. If Cradily sets up, Toxic could eventually be useful. Omastar with Hydro Pump/Ice Beam will be crucial for offense later.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP and Skarmory is at 29% HP. Opponent's Wobbuffet has fainted. Cradily is at 100% HP with Leftovers. Cradily knows Earthquake and Rock Slide, and has Suction Cups, preventing Roar. Skarmory has successfully laid down three layers of Spikes. Skarmory has served its primary purpose of setting Spikes. My current plan is to use Toxic on Cradily to put it on a timer, making its Leftovers recovery less effective. After Toxic, I will likely switch to Omastar to take advantage of its super-effective STAB Water/Ice attacks, or continue to pivot Skarmory if Cradily poses less of a threat. I need to closely monitor Skarmory's HP and use Protect again if needed before switching. Omastar's strong special attacks will be crucial for closing out the game. I still need to scout other Pokémon from the opponent.\n\nHeracross and Deoxys-Attack have fainted. Omastar is at 53% HP and Skarmory is at 35.03% HP. Opponent's Wobbuffet has fainted. Cradily is at 94% HP and already afflicted with Toxic. Cradily knows Earthquake and Rock Slide, and has Suction Cups, preventing Roar. Skarmory has successfully laid down three layers of Spikes and applied Toxic. Now it's time to bring in Omastar to capitalize on its super-effective attacks. Omastar has Hydro Pump and Ice Beam, both strong options against Cradily. I need to closely monitor Omastar's HP against Cradily's attacks, particularly Earthquake. Once Cradily is dealt with, I need to be ready to scout the opponent's other Pokémon, keeping in mind the Spikes damage that will apply on switch-in. I have to manage Omastar's PP and preserve it for other threats if possible."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Omastar has fainted, leaving only Skarmory. The opponent's Cradily is currently active, poisoned by Toxic, and at 94% health. Skarmory is at 35.03% health. Skarmory is immune to Cradily's Earthquake, which was previously used. Cradily also knows Rock Slide, which Skarmory resists. Cradily currently has a status of 'TOX' (toxic poison), meaning it will take increasing damage each turn. The opponent has already lost Wobbuffet and presumably has two other unknown Pokémon. My Skarmory has already set up three layers of Spikes. My primary goal now is to stall out Cradily with Toxic damage while preserving Skarmory as much as possible. Since Cradily resisted my Roar attempt last turn due to Suction Cups, phazing is not an option. My only remaining offensive move on Skarmory is Toxic, which Cradily already has. Therefore, activating Protect this turn is the best action to regain health from Leftovers, scout for Cradily's move if it attacks, and allow Toxic to do more damage.

 \"moves\": [\n    \"rockslide\"\n  ],\n  \"switches\": [\n    \"wobbuffet\",\n    \"kyogre\",\n    \"deoxysspeed\"\n  ]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed is an unknown set. Need to observe its moves, item, and whether it's offensive or support-oriented (e.g., hazards, Taunt, Toxic). Kyogre's Drizzle is active. My team includes physical attacker Aerodactyl, Wobbuffet for trapping/countering, and another Deoxys (likely a setup sweeper or lead based on the moves). Early game, prioritize offense or gather information. Kyogre is a good lead into many setups and can apply heavy pressure.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. It seems to be an offensive variant. Now facing Blissey, which is a special wall. Blissey will likely try to stall or status. Kyogre's Leftovers are gone. I need to boost Kyogre's special attack and defense with Calm Mind. My team includes physical attacker Aerodactyl (Choice Bander), special wall-trap Wobbuffet, and a Deoxys-Speed (likely support with Taunt/Toxic/Knock Off/Recover, based on common sets). Blissey will be tough to break with special moves initially, but repeated Calm Minds can overcome it. If Blissey attempts to use status moves, Kyogre's Substitute could be useful after a few Calm Minds, but for now, boosting its offensive presence is key. After a few Calm Minds, I can consider attacking with Surf or Thunder. If the opponent switches out Blissey, I'll have a boosted Kyogre to apply pressure.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. It was likely an offensive variant. Now facing Blissey, which is a special wall. Blissey used Ice Beam on Kyogre and froze it. This is unfortunate, as Kyogre had just set up a Calm Mind. Switching to Wobbuffet now is the optimal play to trap and remove Blissey. Wobbuffet with Shadow Tag will prevent Blissey from switching out. I can then use Encore to lock Blissey into a passive move or use Counter/Mirror Coat to eliminate it directly. If Blissey is locked into Ice Beam or a similar move, I can use Mirror Coat to inflict significant damage. If it tries to use Protect or another status move, Encore can be used before switching to something that can set up. After Blissey is dealt with, Kyogre can potentially thaw out and continue its sweep, or I can bring in another threat. Still need to identify the rest of the opponent's team.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed is fainted. Blissey is trapped by Wobbuffet. I used Mirror Coat to inflict damage. Next turn, I'll reassess if Blissey is still alive and reconsider my options. If Blissey is knocked out, I'll need to prepare for the opponent's next Pokémon. Kyogre is frozen, which is a problem, but Wobbuffet effectively dealing with Blissey is crucial. Aerodactyl is still healthy and can be used for physical pressure later. Deoxys-Speed is also available. I need to keep track of the remaining Pokémon the opponent has.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed is fainted. Blissey is trapped by Wobbuffet and has taken significant damage. It is healing with Leftovers, but Mirror Coat should still be effective. Kyogre is frozen, which complicates things, but eliminating Blissey first is the priority. Aerodactyl and Deoxys-Speed (support set) are available. If Blissey is knocked out, I need to be ready for the opponent's next Pokémon. The opponent has 2 unrevealed Pokémon left.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed is fainted. Blissey is trapped by Wobbuffet. I am using Mirror Coat to finish off Blissey. After Blissey is dealt with, I will need to assess the opponent's next Pokémon. Kyogre is frozen, which is a major concern for my special attacking presence but still holds potential if it thaws. Aerodactyl and Deoxys-Speed are available for physical attacking and support, respectively. I need to keep track of the remaining two unrevealed Pokémon the opponent has.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed is fainted. Blissey is trapped by Wobbuffet and is now at 40% health. I have consistently used Mirror Coat to chip away at its HP. Kyogre is frozen, which is still a major problem. If Wobbuffet manages to knock out Blissey this turn, I need to consider what the opponent will send out next. Aerodactyl and Deoxys-Speed (support set) are still available to me. I need to keep in mind the remaining two unrevealed Pokémon the opponent has. The strategy remains to eliminate Blissey, then work on un-freezing Kyogre or bringing in another threat.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed is fainted. Blissey is trapped by Wobbuffet and is critically low on health. Successfully using Mirror Coat again should knock it out. Kyogre is still frozen, which is a major concern. Once Blissey is gone, I need to reassess the opponent's next Pokémon and potentially switch to Aerodactyl for physical pressure or Deoxys-Speed for support/utility, or hope Kyogre thaws out. I still need to identify the remaining two Pokémon on the opponent's team.\n\nOpponent's Deoxys-Speed and Blissey are fainted. Moltres is now active at full health. Kyogre is frozen, which is a significant setback to my special attacking presence, but hopefully it thaws out later. Wobbuffet is at very low HP and essentially a fainted Pokémon. I have Aerodactyl and Deoxys-Speed (support set) remaining. Aerodactyl appears to be the best choice against Moltres due to its typing and Choice Band. After Moltres, I'll need to identify the opponent's final Pokémon. If Aerodactyl can take down Moltres, we will be in a much stronger position for the 2v1 against the last opponent Pokémon. I need to be careful with Aerodactyl's Choice Band and predict switches, but for this direct matchup, Rock Slide is the most immediate threat.\n\nOpponent has Moltres active and one unrevealed Pokémon. Deoxys-Speed and Blissey are fainted. My Kyogre is frozen (though it now has a +1 boost from Calm Mind before it was frozen), and Wobbuffet is at 2 HP. Aerodactyl is my current active Pokémon, Choice Banded, and faster than Moltres. Rock Slide is the move to use against Moltres for a likely KO due to its 4x weakness. If Moltres gets knocked out, I predict the opponent will bring in their last Pokémon. I need to keep track of any potential defensive switches the opponent might have, but given Moltres is at full health, a KO is the most pressing objective. Kyogre's thaw condition is a long-term goal. If it defrosts, its boosted stats could be very useful."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Aerodactyl is currently active and the opponent has just switched in Nidoking. My Aerodactyl is Choice Banded and holds the speed advantage. Nidoking is a Ground/Poison type. My moves are Rock Slide, Double-Edge, Earthquake, and Hidden Power. Earthquake is super effective against Nidoking (2x) and would be the optimal move to use here for a potential one-hit KO, due to the Choice Band boost. Rock Slide is neutral damage. Double-Edge is also neutral damage but comes with recoil. Hidden Power's type is unknown but unlikely to be more effective than Earthquake. Therefore, using Earthquake is the best play.", "action": "earthquake", "scratchpad": "Opponent's Deoxys-Speed, Blissey, and Moltres are fainted.

Common sets include hazards (Spikes, Stealth Rock), Taunt, Toxic. Kyogre's Drizzle is active. Kyogre's moves: Calm Mind, Surf, Thunder, Substitute. Aerodactyl: Choice Band offensive. Wobbuffet: Shadow Tag trapping. Deoxys-Speed (my team): Taunt, Toxic, Knock Off, Recover. Need to observe opponent's Deoxys-Speed's item and move choices. Surf is a safe and powerful opening move given the rain. If Deoxys-Speed carries Taunt, it could prevent Calm Mind or Substitute, so attacking first is good. If Deoxys-Speed sets up hazards, Kyogre can still attack. Wobbuffet is a potential counter to Deoxys-Speed if it's a non-attacking variant, but Kyogre has more offensive pressure here.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was almost knocked out by Surf, likely confirming it's not a bulky set. Kyogre's item was Knocked Off, which is a minor setback but won't prevent the KO. Next, I need to consider what the opponent will switch into. Kyogre has good offensive presence with Surf and Thunder, and can boost with Calm Mind. Wobbuffet is available for trapping if an appropriate target comes in. Aerodactyl provides fast physical pressure.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out. Their second Pokémon is Blissey, a special wall. My Kyogre has lost Leftovers but has Calm Mind. I should aim to set up Calm Minds against Blissey to make Kyogre a powerful special attacker. I need to watch out for status conditions like Toxic or Thunder Wave from Blissey. If Blissey has Seismic Toss, I need to consider Kyogre's HP. I can use Substitute later if Blissey only has status moves to avoid them. After a few Calm Minds, Surf or Thunder should be able to break through Blissey. Need to monitor Blissey's moves to see if it carries offensive or support moves beyond status. Kyogre is a strong win condition if it can accumulate boosts.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey, a special wall. Kyogre has lost Leftovers due to Knock Off. Kyogre has already used one Calm Mind; continuing to boost against Blissey is the optimal strategy. Blissey's Ice Beam was resisted and did minimal damage, confirming it's not an immediate offensive threat. I need to be mindful of potential status moves from Blissey (Toxic, Thunder Wave). Once Kyogre has enough Calm Mind boosts, Surf or Thunder will become powerful enough to break through Blissey. After breaking Blissey, Kyogre could potentially sweep the rest of the team depending on their composition. I should consider using Substitute after a few more boosts if Blissey only has status moves to negate them. Currently, Kyogre is at 88% HP, so another Calm Mind is safe.\n\nMy Kyogre is frozen, which is a major setback. Switching into Deoxys-Speed to break the freeze and to potentially Taunt/Toxic Blissey. Deoxys-Speed's Taunt will prevent Blissey from using any non-attacking moves (including potentially healing or status moves). Toxic would put a timer on Blissey. I need to keep track of Kyogre's health and switch it back in if an opportunity arises to continue its sweep. I also need to assess what other Pokémon the opponent might have besides Blissey. Blissey likely carries Seismic Toss as its main damage outside of Ice Beam, and potentially Toxic/Thunder Wave. Deoxys-Speed should be able to outspeed and Taunt Blissey. I will keep Kyogre's stat boosts in mind for when it potentially re-enters the battle.\n\nMy Kyogre is frozen, which is a major setback. Deoxys-Speed is now active against Blissey. Deoxys-Speed's Taunt is critical here to prevent Blissey from using status moves (Toxic, Thunder Wave) or recovery (Softboiled). This forces Blissey to either attack with Ice Beam (which does minimal damage to Deoxys-Speed) or, if it carries Seismic Toss, do fixed damage. If Blissey only has Ice Beam and Seismic Toss, Taunt makes it predictable. I need to observe Blissey's full move set. After Taunt, I can consider Toxic to put a timer on Blissey, or continue to use Knock Off. Recover can be used to heal if Blissey's damage output is low. Kyogre's future re-entry depends on breaking the freeze; in the meantime, Deoxys-Speed is managing Blissey. Aerodactyl and Wobbuffet are still in reserve. Opponent has one fainted Deoxys-Speed and an active Blissey. Two unknown Pokémon remain.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey, a special wall. My Kyogre was frozen by Blissey's Ice Beam. I switched in Deoxys-Speed to Taunt Blissey. Deoxys-Speed successfully Taunted Blissey, forcing it to use Ice Beam. Now with Blissey Taunted, applying Toxic is the optimal play to wear it down. I will continue to monitor Blissey's moves to see if it carries anything else beyond Ice Beam. Deoxys-Speed can use Recover to stay healthy. Once Blissey is significantly weakened or fainted, I can decide whether to switch back to Kyogre (if thawed) or bring in Aerodactyl for offensive pressure. Two opponent Pokémon are still unknown.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey. My Kyogre was frozen by Blissey's Ice Beam. I switched in Deoxys-Speed to Taunt Blissey. Deoxys successfully Taunted Blissey, and Taunt has since worn off. My Deoxys-Speed is at low HP (36%). Kyogre is frozen. Switching to Aerodactyl allows me to apply immediate physical pressure on Blissey, which is likely physically frail. Aerodactyl's Choice Banded Double-Edge or Earthquake will do significant damage. This forces the opponent to either take damage on Blissey or switch out, potentially revealing more of their team. I need to be careful with Aerodactyl's Item, as Double-Edge recoil can be an issue. Wobbuffet is still a potential trapping option for future turns if a specific threat emerges. The opponent's remaining team composition beyond Blissey and the fainted Deoxys-Speed is unknown. I'll need to re-assess after Aerodactyl's turn.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey. Kyogre was frozen by Blissey's Ice Beam. I switched in Deoxys-Speed to Taunt Blissey. Deoxys successfully Taunted Blissey, but Toxic missed, and Taunt wore off. Deoxys-Speed is now at low HP (36%). I switched to Aerodactyl to apply physical pressure. Aerodactyl is Choice Banded and has low HP (32%). Blissey's low physical defense makes Earthquake an optimal choice. This turn, I will use Earthquake to pressure Blissey, aiming to either severely damage it or force a switch. Opponent's remaining team is unknown beyond Blissey. I need to observe their next move carefully.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is active at 58% HP and has used Ice Beam. My Kyogre is frozen. My Deoxys-Speed is at 36%. My Aerodactyl just fainted. I switched to Wobbuffet to trap Blissey. Wobbuffet can use Mirror Coat to potentially one-shot Blissey if it uses Ice Beam again, or Encore to lock it into a move allowing me to attack or switch. This puts me in a good position to remove Blissey. After Blissey is dealt with, I need to reassess Kyogre's status and the remaining opponent team members to determine the win condition. Wobbuffet having Lum Berry is a good counter to status. I need to observe if Blissey has any other moves like Seismic Toss.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is now trapped by Wobbuffet. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aero is fainted. Wobbuffet's main goal here is to remove Blissey for a clean switch or to clear the way for Kyogre later. If Mirror Coat fails to KO, I need to reassess Blissey's remaining health and consider Encore to lock it into a move or try another Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet's Lum Berry provides protection against status if Blissey attempts Toxic or Thunder Wave, but Taunt is gone and should prioritize removing Blissey.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is now trapped by Wobbuffet. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aero is fainted. Wobbuffet's main goal here is to remove Blissey for a clean switch or to clear the way for Kyogre later. Blissey is at 37% HP. Mirror Coat is very likely to KO if Blissey uses another special attack. After Blissey is dealt with, I need to reassess Kyogre's status and the remaining opponent team members to determine the win condition. Wobbuffet having Lum Berry is a good counter to status. I need to observe if Blissey has any other moves like Seismic Toss in case it doesn't use Ice Beam.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is currently trapped by Wobbuffet. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. If Mirror Coat successfully takes out Blissey, I will need to reassess the situation for the next opponent Pokémon. Kyogre's frozen status is still a concern, but removing Blissey is a higher priority now. Wobbuffet has Lum Berry to counter potential status. I will need to consider the remaining opponent Pokémon and if I should switch to Deoxys-Speed to try and break the freeze on Kyogre, or if I should send in Kyogre directly.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey also fainted. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. Wobbuffet is now active against Moltres. Moltres is a Special Attacker. Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat is the best option to trap and potentially KO Moltres. After Moltres faints, I need to reassess the status of Kyogre and Deoxys-Speed, and what the opponent's fourth Pokémon might be. Kyogre still represents a strong win condition if it thaws.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey also fainted. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. Wobbuffet is now active against Moltres. Moltres is a Special Attacker. Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat is the best option to trap and potentially KO Moltres. After Moltres faints, I need to reassess the status of Kyogre and Deoxys-Speed, and what the opponent's fourth Pokémon might be. Kyogre still represents a strong win condition if it thaws. If Moltres doesn't use a special attack, I'll need to consider Encore to trap it, or switch out if Wobbuffet is in danger.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey also fainted. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. Wobbuffet is now active against Moltres. Moltres is a Special Attacker and is at 11% HP. Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat is the best option to trap and potentially KO Moltres. After Moltres faints, I need to reassess the status of Kyogre and Deoxys-Speed, and what the opponent's fourth Pokémon might be. Kyogre still represents a strong win condition if it thaws. If Moltres doesn't use a special attack, I'll need to consider Encore to trap it, or switch out if Wobbuffet is in danger. However, given its current HP and previous move, special attack is likely.\n\nOpponent's team: Deoxys-Speed (fainted), Blissey (fainted), Moltres (fainted), Nidoking (active). My team: Kyogre (frozen, 84% HP, Leftovers lost, 1 Calm Mind), Aerodactyl (fainted), Wobbuffet (active, 3% HP), Deoxys-Speed (36% HP). \n\nKyogre (frozen) is the best immediate switch-in to Nidoking. Kyogre's high Special Defense and HP (even with freeze status) means it can likely take a hit from Nidoking better than a low HP Deoxys-Speed or a fainted Aerodactyl. I need to observe Nidoking's move set. If Kyogre thaws out, it can be a major win condition with its powerful Surf or Thunder (if Nidoking is weak to Electric). If Kyogre doesn't thaw, its future is uncertain, but it's the only real tank left. Deoxys-Speed can be saved for a potential revenge kill or clean-up if Nidoking gets weakened."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Kyogre is currently frozen, which greatly limits its utility. However, Nidoking is out, and Kyogre is still my best bet against it. Kyogre resists Nidoking's likely STAB poison and ground attacks, and its high special defense can potentially tank a hit even while frozen and at reduced HP. While frozen, Kyogre cannot act, but switching it in is the optimal play here to absorb a hit, hope for a thaw, and potentially win the game if it thaws. Wobbuffet is at 3% HP and would faint to almost any hit from Nidoking. My Deoxys-Speed is also at low health and is frail. Kyogre, despite the freeze and reduced HP, offers the most defensive presence and offensive potential (if it thaws) against Nidoking.

]\n}\nScratchpad (from previous turn):\nOpponent's lead is Deoxys-Speed. Common sets include hazards (Spikes, Stealth Rock), Taunt, Toxic. Kyogre's Drizzle is active. Kyogre's moves: Calm Mind, Surf, Thunder, Substitute. Aerodactyl: Choice Band offensive. Wobbuffet: Shadow Tag trapping. Deoxys-Speed (my team): Taunt, Toxic, Knock Off, Recover. Need to observe opponent's Deoxys-Speed's item and move choices. Surf is a safe and powerful opening move given the rain. If Deoxys-Speed carries Taunt, it could prevent Calm Mind or Substitute, so attacking first is good. If Deoxys-Speed sets up hazards, Kyogre can still attack. Wobbuffet is a potential counter to Deoxys-Speed if it's a non-attacking variant, but Kyogre has more offensive pressure here.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was almost knocked out by Surf, likely confirming it's not a bulky set. Kyogre's item was Knocked Off, which is a minor setback but won't prevent the KO. Next, I need to consider what the opponent will switch into. Kyogre has good offensive presence with Surf and Thunder, and can boost with Calm Mind. Wobbuffet is available for trapping if an appropriate target comes in. Aerodactyl provides fast physical pressure.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out. Their second Pokémon is Blissey, a special wall. My Kyogre has lost Leftovers but has Calm Mind. I should aim to set up Calm Minds against Blissey to make Kyogre a powerful special attacker. I need to watch out for status conditions like Toxic or Thunder Wave from Blissey. If Blissey has Seismic Toss, I need to consider Kyogre's HP. I can use Substitute later if Blissey only has status moves to avoid them. After a few Calm Minds, Surf or Thunder should be able to break through Blissey. Need to monitor Blissey's moves to see if it carries offensive or support moves beyond status. Kyogre is a strong win condition if it can accumulate boosts.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey, a special wall. Kyogre has lost Leftovers due to Knock Off. Kyogre has already used one Calm Mind; continuing to boost against Blissey is the optimal strategy. Blissey's Ice Beam was resisted and did minimal damage, confirming it's not an immediate offensive threat. I need to be mindful of potential status moves from Blissey (Toxic, Thunder Wave). Once Kyogre has enough Calm Mind boosts, Surf or Thunder will become powerful enough to break through Blissey. After breaking Blissey, Kyogre could potentially sweep the rest of the team depending on their composition. I should consider using Substitute after a few more boosts if Blissey only has status moves to negate them. Currently, Kyogre is at 88% HP, so another Calm Mind is safe.\n\nMy Kyogre is frozen, which is a major setback. Switching into Deoxys-Speed to break the freeze and to potentially Taunt/Toxic Blissey. Deoxys-Speed's Taunt will prevent Blissey from using any non-attacking moves (including potentially healing or status moves). Toxic would put a timer on Blissey. I need to keep track of Kyogre's health and switch it back in if an opportunity arises to continue its sweep. I also need to assess what other Pokémon the opponent might have besides Blissey. Blissey likely carries Seismic Toss as its main damage outside of Ice Beam, and potentially Toxic/Thunder Wave. Deoxys-Speed should be able to outspeed and Taunt Blissey. I will keep Kyogre's stat boosts in mind for when it potentially re-enters the battle.\n\nMy Kyogre is frozen, which is a major setback. Deoxys-Speed is now active against Blissey. Deoxys-Speed's Taunt is critical here to prevent Blissey from using status moves (Toxic, Thunder Wave) or recovery (Softboiled). This forces Blissey to either attack with Ice Beam (which does minimal damage to Deoxys-Speed) or, if it carries Seismic Toss, do fixed damage. If Blissey only has Ice Beam and Seismic Toss, Taunt makes it predictable. I need to observe Blissey's full move set. After Taunt, I can consider Toxic to put a timer on Blissey, or continue to use Knock Off. Recover can be used to heal if Blissey's damage output is low. Kyogre's future re-entry depends on breaking the freeze; in the meantime, Deoxys-Speed is managing Blissey. Aerodactyl and Wobbuffet are still in reserve. Opponent has one fainted Deoxys-Speed and an active Blissey. Two unknown Pokémon remain.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey, a special wall. My Kyogre was frozen by Blissey's Ice Beam. I switched in Deoxys-Speed to Taunt Blissey. Deoxys-Speed successfully Taunted Blissey, forcing it to use Ice Beam. Now with Blissey Taunted, applying Toxic is the optimal play to wear it down. I will continue to monitor Blissey's moves to see if it carries anything else beyond Ice Beam. Deoxys-Speed can use Recover to stay healthy. Once Blissey is significantly weakened or fainted, I can decide whether to switch back to Kyogre (if thawed) or bring in Aerodactyl for offensive pressure. Two opponent Pokémon are still unknown.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey. My Kyogre was frozen by Blissey's Ice Beam. I switched in Deoxys-Speed to Taunt Blissey. Deoxys successfully Taunted Blissey, and Taunt has since worn off. My Deoxys-Speed is at low HP (36%). Kyogre is frozen. Switching to Aerodactyl allows me to apply immediate physical pressure on Blissey, which is likely physically frail. Aerodactyl's Choice Banded Double-Edge or Earthquake will do significant damage. This forces the opponent to either take damage on Blissey or switch out, potentially revealing more of their team. I need to be careful with Aerodactyl's Item, as Double-Edge recoil can be an issue. Wobbuffet is still a potential trapping option for future turns if a specific threat emerges. The opponent's remaining team composition beyond Blissey and the fainted Deoxys-Speed is unknown. I'll need to re-assess after Aerodactyl's turn.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed was taken out by Kyogre's Surf. Opponent switched in Blissey. Kyogre was frozen by Blissey's Ice Beam. I switched in Deoxys-Speed to Taunt Blissey. Deoxys successfully Taunted Blissey, but Toxic missed, and Taunt wore off. Deoxys-Speed is now at low HP (36%). I switched to Aerodactyl to apply physical pressure. Aerodactyl is Choice Banded and has low HP (32%). Blissey's low physical defense makes Earthquake an optimal choice. This turn, I will use Earthquake to pressure Blissey, aiming to either severely damage it or force a switch. Opponent's remaining team is unknown beyond Blissey. I need to observe their next move carefully.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is active at 58% HP and has used Ice Beam. My Kyogre is frozen. My Deoxys-Speed is at 36%. My Aerodactyl just fainted. I switched to Wobbuffet to trap Blissey. Wobbuffet can use Mirror Coat to potentially one-shot Blissey if it uses Ice Beam again, or Encore to lock it into a move allowing me to attack or switch. This puts me in a good position to remove Blissey. After Blissey is dealt with, I need to reassess Kyogre's status and the remaining opponent team members to determine the win condition. Wobbuffet having Lum Berry is a good counter to status. I need to observe if Blissey has any other moves like Seismic Toss.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is now trapped by Wobbuffet. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aero is fainted. Wobbuffet's main goal here is to remove Blissey for a clean switch or to clear the way for Kyogre later. If Mirror Coat fails to KO, I need to reassess Blissey's remaining health and consider Encore to lock it into a move or try another Mirror Coat. Wobbuffet's Lum Berry provides protection against status if Blissey attempts Toxic or Thunder Wave, but Taunt is gone and should prioritize removing Blissey.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is now trapped by Wobbuffet. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aero is fainted. Wobbuffet's main goal here is to remove Blissey for a clean switch or to clear the way for Kyogre later. Blissey is at 37% HP. Mirror Coat is very likely to KO if Blissey uses another special attack. After Blissey is dealt with, I need to reassess Kyogre's status and the remaining opponent team members to determine the win condition. Wobbuffet having Lum Berry is a good counter to status. I need to observe if Blissey has any other moves like Seismic Toss in case it doesn't use Ice Beam.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey is currently trapped by Wobbuffet. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. If Mirror Coat successfully takes out Blissey, I will need to reassess the situation for the next opponent Pokémon. Kyogre's frozen status is still a concern, but removing Blissey is a higher priority now. Wobbuffet has Lum Berry to counter potential status. I will need to consider the remaining opponent Pokémon and if I should switch to Deoxys-Speed to try and break the freeze on Kyogre, or if I should send in Kyogre directly.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey also fainted. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. Wobbuffet is now active against Moltres. Moltres is a Special Attacker. Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat is the best option to trap and potentially KO Moltres. After Moltres faints, I need to reassess the status of Kyogre and Deoxys-Speed, and what the opponent's fourth Pokémon might be. Kyogre still represents a strong win condition if it thaws.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey also fainted. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. Wobbuffet is now active against Moltres. Moltres is a Special Attacker. Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat is the best option to trap and potentially KO Moltres. After Moltres faints, I need to reassess the status of Kyogre and Deoxys-Speed, and what the opponent's fourth Pokémon might be. Kyogre still represents a strong win condition if it thaws. If Moltres doesn't use a special attack, I'll need to consider Encore to trap it, or switch out if Wobbuffet is in danger.\n\nOpponent's lead Deoxys-Speed fainted. Blissey also fainted. Kyogre is frozen and Deoxys-Speed is at low HP. Aerodactyl is fainted. Wobbuffet is now active against Moltres. Moltres is a Special Attacker and is at 11% HP. Wobbuffet's Mirror Coat is the best option to trap and potentially KO Moltres. After Moltres faints, I need to reassess the status of Kyogre and Deoxys-Speed, and what the opponent's fourth Pokémon might be. Kyogre still represents a strong win condition if it thaws. If Moltres doesn't use a special attack, I'll need to consider Encore to trap it, or switch out if Wobbuffet is in danger. However, given its current HP and previous move, special attack is likely.\n\nOpponent's team: Deoxys-Speed (fainted), Blissey (fainted), Moltres (fainted), Nidoking (active). My team: Kyogre (frozen, 84% HP, Leftovers lost, 1 Calm Mind), Aerodactyl (fainted), Wobbuffet (active, 3% HP), Deoxys-Speed (36% HP). \n\nKyogre (frozen) is the best immediate switch-in to Nidoking. Kyogre's high Special Defense and HP (even with freeze status) means it can likely take a hit from Nidoking better than a low HP Deoxys-Speed or a fainted Aerodactyl. I need to observe Nidoking's move set. If Kyogre thaws out, it can be a major win condition with its powerful Surf or Thunder (if Nidoking is weak to Electric). If Kyogre doesn't thaw, its future is uncertain, but it's the only real tank left. Deoxys-Speed can be saved for a potential revenge kill or clean-up if Nidoking gets weakened.\n\nOpponent's team: Deoxys-Speed (fainted), Blissey (fainted), Moltres (fainted), Nidoking (active). My team: Kyogre (frozen, 40.10% HP, Leftovers lost, 1 Calm Mind), Aerodactyl (fainted), Wobbuffet (active, 3.45% HP), Deoxys-Speed (36.51% HP). \n\nKyogre (frozen) is the best immediate switch-in to Nidoking. Kyogre's high Special Defense and HP (even with freeze status) means it can likely take a hit from Nidoking better than a low HP Deoxys-Speed or a fainted Aerodactyl. I need to observe Nidoking's move set. If Kyogre thaws out, it can be a major win condition with its powerful Surf or Thunder (if Nidoking is weak to Electric). If Kyogre doesn't thaw, its future is uncertain, but it's the only real tank left. Deoxys-Speed can be saved for a potential revenge kill or clean-up if Nidoking gets weakened. My Wobbuffet is too frail to stay in. Kyogre is the only sensible switch to try and leverage its typing and bulk against Nidoking, despite the freeze status. I will hope for a thaw, as Kyogre is a strong answer to Nidoking if it can attack.\n\nMy team: Kyogre (frozen, 40.10% HP, Leftovers lost, 1 Calm Mind), Aerodactyl (fainted), Wobbuffet (active, 3.45% HP), Deoxys-Speed (36.51% HP). Opponent's team: Deoxys-Speed (fainted), Blissey (fainted), Moltres (fainted), Nidoking (active). Kyogre took a Megahorn from Nidoking. Despite Kyogre being frozen, it is still the best pivot due to its natural bulk and typing against Nidoking. However, with Kyogre frozen, I cannot capitalize on its offensive potential. My Wobbuffet is nearly fainted, and Deoxys-Speed is also low but might be able to survive a hit. I need to preserve Deoxys-Speed if possible for a revenge kill or to potentially get rid of Nidoking. Since Kyogre is already in and frozen, I made the active decision to keep it in and take another hit from Nidoking, hoping for a thaw. However, the system shows that my Kyogre is listed as fainted! This means my only remaining options are Wobbuffet (3.45%) and Deoxys-Speed (36.51%). Given Kyogre is fainted, I must switch. Wobbuffet is too frail (3.45% HP) and would almost certainly faint to any move from Nidoking. Deoxys-Speed, while low, has more HP (36.51%) and potentially a chance to do something, even if it's just a Knock Off or Toxic before fainting. It's a losing battle, but I will send out Deoxys-Speed as it is the only viable option with any remaining HP."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Kyogre has unexpectedly fainted after taking another Megahorn from Nidoking.

While Deoxys-Speed is also low on health, it is my only remaining option that can potentially survive a hit or at least get off one more action (like Toxic or Knock Off) against Nidoking.

Mew (Psychic). Fire Blast is 2x effective. Need to watch for special defense on Muk. Mew has Lum Berry, so status is less of a concern. Next turn, consider Thunder Wave if Muk stays in and survives, or switch if it resists strongly or sets up. Keep track of what other Pokemon the opponent has. Potential Muk sets could include Curse, Acid Armor, or Minimize to stall, or Sludge Bomb for offensive pressure if it's physical. With no specific information, an immediate attack is best.\n\nMy Mew is at risk at low HP against Muk. Muk has Leftovers and Sludge Bomb. I've switched to Suicune to absorb a hit and assess the opponent's strategy further. Suicune is a bulky special defender and can potentially set up with Calm Mind or phaze with Roar. Will observe Muk's next move. Need to determine if Muk is physical or special, its full move set, and if it carries any status moves. Note that I used Fire Blast, and Muk survived and healed a bit, so it's likely a relatively bulky Muk. Keep track of other opponent Pokémon revealed. Aggron is an option later if physical, Zapdos if more special, but Suicune is good against both.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune resisted Sludge Bomb and took minimal damage. This suggests Muk is not a significant offensive threat against Suicune. Suicune can leverage this to set up with Calm Mind, boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense, making it more difficult to take down and allowing it to hit harder with Surf. I need to observe if Muk has any status moves like Toxic or support moves that could hinder Suicune's setup. If Muk switches out, I will adjust my strategy accordingly. Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full. Keep track of Muk's full moveset and any other opponent Pokémon. This setup opportunity with Suicune against Muk is valuable for securing the mid-game position.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune has successfully used Calm Mind twice, boosting its special stats significantly. Muk's Sludge Bomb (physical) and Focus Punch (physical) are not heavily damaging Suicune. I need to keep track of Muk's full moveset and ability. Its current strategy with Focus Punch seems to be trying to hit Suicune hard, but my Calm Minds are nullifying the threat by boosting my defenses. With two Calm Mind boosts, Surf should become a very potent attack. I must remember that Focus Punch can be interrupted by any damaging move, so if I decide to attack next turn, I can prevent Focus Punch. My Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full. Suicune is setting itself up to be a late-game sweeper. The plan is to get 2-3 Calm Minds up, and then sweep with Surf, or use Roar if a more dangerous setup sweeper comes in. I still need to confirm Muk's item and ability if possible, but Leftovers has been observed. No specific ability has been identified for Muk, which is unusual. This could imply Stench or Sticky Hold, neither of which significantly impact this matchup unless I switch often. Given Muk's low speed, Suicune will almost always move first, allowing it to dictate the pace.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune has now used Calm Mind twice, making it more difficult to take down and allowing it to hit harder. Muk's Sludge Bomb (physical) and Focus Punch (physical) are not heavily damaging Suicune, and its Focus Punch has been scouted multiple times. With Suicune at +2 Special Attack and Special Defense, it's in a good position to continue setting up. Muk is still nearly full HP, but Suicune's increased offensive presence with another Calm Mind boost will make Surf a significant threat. My Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full. The plan is to get 2-3 more Calm Minds up, aiming for +4 or +6 in Special Attack, and then sweep with Surf, or use Roar if a more dangerous setup sweeper comes in. I still need to confirm Muk's item and ability if possible, but Leftovers has been observed. No specific ability has been identified for Muk, which is unusual. This could imply Stench or Sticky Hold, neither of which significantly impact this matchup unless I switch often. Given Muk's low speed, Suicune will almost always move first, allowing it to dictate the pace. I will continue to Calm Mind this turn, leveraging Muk's predictable Focus Punch use.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune has accumulated 3 Calm Mind boosts (+3 Special Attack and Special Defense). Muk continues to use Focus Punch, which is damaging Suicune but at a predictable pace. Suicune's HP is critically low (18.95%). The current strategy is to use Rest to recover full HP, then continue to leverage the Calm Mind boosts to either sweep with Surf or use Roar if a more dangerous setup sweeper comes in. After Rest, Suicune will be fully restored and can continue to apply pressure. I still need to confirm Muk's item and abilities. The observed Leftovers on Muk and the consistent Focus Punch indicate a physical offensive set, but not one that can break through a fully set up Suicune if it manages to maintain health. The plan is to get Suicune healthy, potentially stack one or two more Calm Minds, and then sweep with Surf. Keep track of other opponent Pokémon revealed. Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full and available if Suicune falters."}], "response": {"reasoning": "My Suicune is currently asleep from using Rest last turn, but it has regained a significant amount of health and is at +3 in both Special Attack and Special Defense. Muk continues to use Focus Punch, which will hit Suicune this turn. Since Suicune is asleep, it cannot take any action except for the automatic action of potentially waking up. The opponent's Muk is at 100% health, but considering Suicune's boosts, once it wakes up, Surf will be very powerful. There's no strategic advantage to switching out a sleeping Pokémon with strong boosts; it's better to let it wake up naturally and then capitalize on its strong position. Thus, I have no selectable action this turn, other than to do nothing.", "action": "pass", "scratchpad": "Opponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune is now asleep after using Rest, but at high HP and with +3 in Special Attack and Special Defense. Muk continues to spam Focus Punch. Suicune needs to wake up to continue the setup or begin attacking. Once Suicune wakes up, it will be a major threat. I need to monitor how many turns Suicune remains asleep. Muk's consistent use of Focus Punch indicates a predictable strategy, which Suicune can exploit once awake. If Muk switches out, I will reassess the situation and potentially switch to Mew or Aggron/Zapdos if I anticipate a super-effective hit, or continue with Suicune if still strong. The plan remains to unleash powerful Surfs once awake. I still need to confirm Muk's item and full abilities, but Leftovers and a physical attacker approach are observed."}, "outcome": "invalid", "is_valid_response": false}

Mew (Psychic). Fire Blast is 2x effective. Need to watch for special defense on Muk. Mew has Lum Berry, so status is less of a concern. Next turn, consider Thunder Wave if Muk stays in and survives, or switch if it resists strongly or sets up. Keep track of what other Pokemon the opponent has. Potential Muk sets could include Curse, Acid Armor, or Minimize to stall, or Sludge Bomb for offensive pressure if it's physical. With no specific information, an immediate attack is best.\n\nMy Mew is at risk at low HP against Muk. Muk has Leftovers and Sludge Bomb. I've switched to Suicune to absorb a hit and assess the opponent's strategy further. Suicune is a bulky special defender and can potentially set up with Calm Mind or phaze with Roar. Will observe Muk's next move. Need to determine if Muk is physical or special, its full move set, and if it carries any status moves. Note that I used Fire Blast, and Muk survived and healed a bit, so it's likely a relatively bulky Muk. Keep track of other opponent Pokémon revealed. Aggron is an option later if physical, Zapdos if more special, but Suicune is good against both.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune resisted Sludge Bomb and took minimal damage. This suggests Muk is not a significant offensive threat against Suicune. Suicune can leverage this to set up with Calm Mind, boosting its Special Attack and Special Defense, making it more difficult to take down and allowing it to hit harder with Surf. I need to observe if Muk has any status moves like Toxic or support moves that could hinder Suicune's setup. If Muk switches out, I will adjust my strategy accordingly. Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full. Keep track of Muk's full moveset and any other opponent Pokémon. This setup opportunity with Suicune against Muk is valuable for securing the mid-game position.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune has successfully used Calm Mind twice, boosting its special stats significantly. Muk's Sludge Bomb (physical) and Focus Punch (physical) are not heavily damaging Suicune. I need to keep track of Muk's full moveset and ability. Its current strategy with Focus Punch seems to be trying to hit Suicune hard, but my Calm Minds are nullifying the threat by boosting my defenses. With two Calm Mind boosts, Surf should become a very potent attack. I must remember that Focus Punch can be interrupted by any damaging move, so if I decide to attack next turn, I can prevent Focus Punch. My Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full. Suicune is setting itself up to be a late-game sweeper. The plan is to get 2-3 Calm Minds up, and then sweep with Surf, or use Roar if a more dangerous setup sweeper comes in. I still need to confirm Muk's item and ability if possible, but Leftovers has been observed. No specific ability has been identified for Muk, which is unusual. This could imply Stench or Sticky Hold, neither of which significantly impact this matchup unless I switch often. Given Muk's low speed, Suicune will almost always move first, allowing it to dictate the pace.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune has now used Calm Mind twice, making it more difficult to take down and allowing it to hit harder. Muk's Sludge Bomb (physical) and Focus Punch (physical) are not heavily damaging Suicune, and its Focus Punch has been scouted multiple times. With Suicune at +2 Special Attack and Special Defense, it's in a good position to continue setting up. Muk is still nearly full HP, but Suicune's increased offensive presence with another Calm Mind boost will make Surf a significant threat. My Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full. The plan is to get 2-3 more Calm Minds up, aiming for +4 or +6 in Special Attack, and then sweep with Surf, or use Roar if a more dangerous setup sweeper comes in. I still need to confirm Muk's item and ability if possible, but Leftovers has been observed. No specific ability has been identified for Muk, which is unusual. This could imply Stench or Sticky Hold, neither of which significantly impact this matchup unless I switch often. Given Muk's low speed, Suicune will almost always move first, allowing it to dictate the pace. I will continue to Calm Mind this turn, leveraging Muk's predictable Focus Punch use.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune has accumulated 3 Calm Mind boosts (+3 Special Attack and Special Defense). Muk continues to use Focus Punch, which is damaging Suicune but at a predictable pace. Suicune's HP is critically low (18.95%). The current strategy is to use Rest to recover full HP, then continue to leverage the Calm Mind boosts to either sweep with Surf or use Roar if a more dangerous setup sweeper comes in. After Rest, Suicune will be fully restored and can continue to apply pressure. I still need to confirm Muk's item and abilities. The observed Leftovers on Muk and the consistent Focus Punch indicate a physical offensive set, but not one that can break through a fully set up Suicune if it manages to maintain health. The plan is to get Suicune healthy, potentially stack one or two more Calm Minds, and then sweep with Surf. Keep track of other opponent Pokémon revealed. Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full and available if Suicune falters.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune is now asleep after using Rest, but at high HP and with +3 in Special Attack and Special Defense. Muk continues to spam Focus Punch. Suicune needs to wake up to continue the setup or begin attacking. Once Suicune wakes up, it will be a major threat. I need to monitor how many turns Suicune remains asleep. Muk's consistent use of Focus Punch indicates a predictable strategy, which Suicune can exploit once awake. If Muk switches out, I will reassess the situation and potentially switch to Mew or Aggron/Zapdos if I anticipate a super-effective hit, or continue with Suicune if still strong. The plan remains to unleash powerful Surfs once awake. I still need to confirm Muk's item and full abilities, but Leftovers and a physical attacker approach are observed.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune is asleep from Rest, but has +3 in Special Attack and Special Defense. Muk continues to use Focus Punch. Suicune's HP is good. The current turn is a waiting game for Suicune to wake up. Once awake, Suicune can continue to apply pressure with Calm Mind or start sweeping with Surf. If Muk switches out, I will reassess the situation. The goal is to fully sweep with Suicune after it wakes up. Keep track of other opponent Pokémon revealed. Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full and available if Suicune falters or a better matchup arises.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water). Suicune is asleep from Rest, but has +3 in Special Attack and Special Defense. Muk continues to use Focus Punch, which is a predictable pattern. Suicune's HP is decent due to Leftovers recovery. This turn is a waiting game for Suicune to wake up. Once awake, Suicune can continue to apply pressure with Calm Mind or start sweeping with Surf. If Muk switches out, I will reassess the situation. The goal is to fully sweep with Suicune after it wakes up. Keep track of other opponent Pokémon revealed. Mew is at low HP, Aggron and Zapdos are full and available if Suicune falters or a better matchup arises. Muk's consistent strategy with Focus Punch implies it does not have other immediate threats or setup moves that can surprise Suicune. I expect Suicune to wake up within the next 1-2 turns, at which point it can proceed with its sweep.\n\nOpponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water).

Since Suicune is asleep, the only available actions that make sense are for Suicune to continue being unable to move due to sleep. There is no strategic option to switch either, as Suicune's high Special Defense and current boosts make it a strong candidate to stay in and continue setting up for a sweep once it wakes up. If I were to switch, I risk losing the Calm Mind boosts, and Muk's Focus Punch would hit the switched-in Pokémon for full damage without the protection of the sleep turns and boosts obtained by Suicune. Therefore, the best course of action is to let Suicune to naturally wake up.", "action": "cant", "scratchpad": "Opponent Muk (Poison) vs. Suicune (Water).

Dugtrio is extremely fast and can have a devastating Earthquake, which Celebi takes super effective damage from. While Celebi is a special attacker, its Psychic move would do decent damage, but Dugtrio is likely faster and could OHKO or severely damage Celebi first. Switching out to a Pokémon that resists Ground is the safest play. Metagross is largely immune to Psychic and resistant to Ground, making it an excellent switch-in against Dugtrio. This allows me to gain momentum, potentially scout Dugtrio's actual move, and threaten it with a super effective Meteor Mash or Earthquake of my own if it stays in. Wobbuffet also resists Psychic but is still vulnerable to Earthquake and is intended as a revenge killer/trapper for later in the game. Kabutops would take neutral damage from Earthquake and I don't know Dugtrio's item or specific EVs, so it's not worth the risk. Therefore, Metagross is the optimal switch.", "action": "metagross", "scratchpad": "My Team: Celebi (special attacker/support), Wobbuffet (revenge killer/trap), Metagross (physical attacker), Kabutops (sweeper). \nOpponent's lead: Dugtrio (likely physical attacker, very fast, Arena Trap).
